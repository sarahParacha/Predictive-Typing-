Lesson 10\nImplementing Operational Procedures\n\nLESSON INTRODUCTION\nAs a CompTIA® A+® technician, you will be asked to install, configure, maintain, and correct problems with a variety of computer components and software. You will usually be performing this work within the context of a company's operational procedures. You have already explored procedures governing safe working practices, regulated data and content, incident response, and ways of using remote access to handle problems more efficiently.\n\nOther types of operational procedures are designed to ensure the secure and efficient functioning of the IT system. Companies need documentation and change management procedures to keep the use of systems under control, potentially using scripting to ensure standardized configuration changes. They need plans to cope with disasters so that data loss and system downtime is minimized. They need to ensure the physical environment is optimized and does not present any health hazards. This lesson will help you to identify the technologies that underpin these important procedures.\ntag: C2 L10

Topic A\nUse Appropriate Safety Procedures\n\nEXAM OBJECTIVES COVERED\n1002-4.4 Explain common safety procedures.\n\nTo complete PC support tasks without damaging the equipment that you are servicing, or causing physical injury to yourself or others, there are several tools to use and operational procedures to follow in order to get the job done quickly, safely, and correctly. In this topic, you will identify the best practices for PC technicians to follow to promote electrical and environmental safety.\ntag: C2 L10 TA

LOCAL GOVERNMENT REGULATIONS\n\nWhen performing PC maintenance work, you may need to take account of compliance with government regulations. Regulations that typically affect PC maintenance or the installation of new equipment are:\n\n• Health and safety laws: Keeping the workplace free from hazards.\n\n• Building codes: Ensuring that fire prevention and electrical systems are intact and safe.\n\n• Environmental regulations: Disposing of waste correctly.\n\nFor example, in the United States, the most common safety regulations are those issued by the federal government, such as the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), and state standards regarding employee safety. OSHA-compliant employers must provide:\n\n• Aworkplace that is free from recognized hazards that could cause serious physical harm.\n\n• Personal protective equipment designed to protect employees from certain hazards.\n\n• Communication—in the form of labeling, Material Safety Data Sheets (MSDSs), and training about hazardous materials.\n\nWhile specific regulations may vary from country to country and state to state, in general employers are responsible for providing a safe and healthy working environment for their employees. Employees have a responsibility to use equipment in the workplace in accordance with the guidelines given to them and to report any hazards. Employees should also not interfere with any safety systems, including signs or warnings or devices such as firefighting equipment. Employees should not introduce or install devices, equipment, or materials to the workplace without authorization or without making an assessment of the installation.\ntag: C2 L10 TA

HEALTH AND SAFETY PROCEDURES\n\nA company's health and safety procedures should be set out in a handbook, possibly a part of an employee's induction handbook. Health and safety procedures should:\n\n• Identify what to do in the event of a fire or other emergency.\n\n• Identify responsible persons (for example, for overall health and safety, nominated first aiders, fire marshals, and so on).\n\n• Identify hazardous areas in the workspace and precautions to take when entering them.\n\n• Describe best practice for use and care of the workspace and equipment within it.\n\n• Establish an incident reporting procedure for detecting and eliminating workplace hazards and accidents.\ntag: C2 L10 TA

GENERAL EMERGENCY PROCEDURES\n\nHere is a general procedure for emergency situations:\n\n1. Raise the alarm and contact the emergency services, giving them a description of the emergency and your location.\n\n2. If possible, make the scene safe. For example, if you are faced with a fire, establish that you have an escape route, or if faced with electrical shock, disconnect the power (if it is safe for you to do so).\n\n3. If you have training and it is safe to do so, do what you can to tackle the emergency (for example, give first aid or use firefighting equipment).\n\nOf course, circumstances might dictate that you do something differently. it is vital that you keep calm and do not act rashly.\ntag: C2 L10 TA

ELECTRICAL HAZARDS\n\nThe most prevalent physical hazards that computer technicians face are electrical hazards. Electricity is necessary to run a computer, but it can also damage sensitive computer equipment, and in some cases, pose a danger to humans. Following established best practices for promoting electrical safety will protect not only the computer equipment that you work on, but also your personal safety and the safety of others.\n\nElectrical equipment can give an electric shock if it is broken, faulty, or installed incorrectly. An electric shock can cause muscle spasms, severe burns, or even kill (electrocution).\n\nElectrical currents can pass through metal and most liquids, so neither should be allowed to come into contact with any electrical device installations. Damaged components or cables are also a risk and should be replaced or isolated immediately. It Is important to test electrical devices regularly. The frequency will depend on the environment in which the device is used. In some countries, portable appliance testing (PAT) carried out by a qualified electrician or technician ensures that a device is safe to use.\n\nThe human body is an electrical conductor and a resistor, so a current will pass through it and make it heat up, manifesting as a burn if the current is strong enough. A current can interfere with the body's nervous system, which also uses electrical signals. This might manifest as spasm or paralysis or in a severe case cause a heart attack. Collateral injuries occur when involuntary muscle contractions caused by the shock cause the body to fall or come in contact with sharp edges or electrically live parts.\n\nElectricity can hurt you even if you are careful and avoid becoming part of an electrical ground circuit. The heat generated by an electric arc or electrical equipment can burn your skin or set your clothes on fire.\n\nNote: High voltages (over about 30V) are more dangerous because they have the power to push more current through you (skin's resistance drops at higher voltages), but it is the current that causes the actual damage. This is why static electricity is not dangerous to you, despite the high voltages. More current will flow if a larger area of your body is exposed.\ntag: C2 L10 TA

FUSES\n\nAn electrical device must be fitted with a fuse appropriate to its power output. A fuse blows if there is a problem with the electrical supply, breaking the circuit to the power source. Fuses come in different ratings, such as 3A, 5A, and 13A. A device's instructions, will indicate what rating of fuse to use, but most computer equipment is rated at 3A or 5A. If the fuse fitted is rated too low, it will blow too easily; if the rating is too high, it may not blow when it should (it will allow too much current to pass through the device).\n\nIf multiple devices need to be attached to a single power point, a power strip of sockets should be used. If too many devices are attached to a single point, there is a risk that they will overheat and cause a fire. "Daisy-chaining" one power strip to another is dangerous. The total amperage of devices connected to the strip must not exceed the strip's maximum load (typically 12 amps).\ntag: C2 L10 TA

EQUIPMENT GROUNDING\n\nElectrical equipment must also be grounded (or earthed). If there is a fault that causes metal parts in the equipment to become live, a ground provides a path of least resistance for the electrical current to flow away harmlessly. Most computer products (PCs, printers, and so on) are connected to the building ground via the power plug However, the large metal equipment racks often used to house servers and network equipment must also be grounded. Do not disconnect the ground wire. If ithas to be removed, make sure it is replaced by a competent electrician.\n\n[file:///fig-502.png]\nGrounding terminals and wires.

HIGH VOLTAGE DEVICE SAFETY\n\nMost of the internal circuitry in a computer is low voltage (12 V or less) and low current, so there is not much of a threat to your personal safety. However, there are exceptions to this, and these exceptions can be very dangerous. Power supplies, CRT monitors, the inverter card in an LCD display's fluorescent backlight, and laser printers can carry dangerously high levels of voltage. Charges held in capacitors can persist for hours after the power supply is turned off. You should not open these units unless you have been specifically trained to do so. Adhere to all printed warnings, and never remove or break open any safety devices that carry such a warning.\n\nCaution: Never insert anything into the power supply fan to get it to rotate. This approach does not work, and it is dangerous.\ntag: C2 L10 TA

ELECTRICAL FIRE SAFETY\n\nFaulty electrical equipment can pose a fire risk. Ifthe equipment allows more current to flow through a cable than the cable is rated for, the cable will heat up. This could ignite flammable material close to the cable. if an electrical wire does start a fire, it is important to use the correct type of extinguisher to put it out. Many extinguishers use water or foam, which can be dangerous if used near live electrical equipment. The best type to use is a Carbon Dioxide (CO,) gas extinguisher. CO, extinguishers have a black label. Dry powder extinguishers can also be used, though these can damage electronic equipment.\n\nCaution: Care must be taken in confined spaces as the CO, plus smoke from the fire wil quickly replace the available oxygen, making it hard to breathe.\n\nYou should also ensure that the electricity supply is turned off. This should happen automatically (the fuses for the circuit should trip), but make sure you know the location of the power master switches for a building.\ntag: C2 L10 TA

GUIDELINES FOR WORKING SAFELY WITH ELECTRICAL SYSTEMS\n\nConsider these guidelines as you prepare to work with electrical equipment.\n\nELECTRICAL SAFETY\nFollow these guidelines to work safely with electrical systems:\n\n• Do not work on electrical systems unless you have a good understanding of the risks and appropriate safety procedures.\n\n• Do not attempt repair work when you are tired; you may make careless mistakes, and your primary diagnostic tool, deductive reasoning, will not be operating at full capacity.\n\n• Do not assume anything without checking it out for yourself. A ground wire might have been disconnected or never properly installed, for example.\n\n• Disconnect the power to a circuit if you must handle it.\n\n• Hold down the power button on the device to ensure the circuits are drained of residual power.\n\n• Test live parts with a multimeter to ensure that no voltage is present.\n\n• Always use properly insulated tools and never grip a tool by its metal parts.\n\nNote: It is especially important not to touch the live parts of multimeter probes, as these may be connected to an energized circuit. Handle the probes by the insulated sheaths only.\n\n• Take care not to touch any part of a circuit with both hands to reduce the risk of a serious shock. This is called the "hand in pocket" rule. it reduces the chance that the current will pass through your chest and cause a heart attack.\n\n• Make sure your hands and the surrounding area are dry. Sweat can make your hands more conductive.\n\n• Do not leave any spill hazards in the vicinity and ensure you are not standing on a wet floor.\n\n• Do not wear jewelry or a wrist watch or other items such as name badges that may dangle from your neck or wrist and cause a short circuit or become trapped by moving parts.\ntag: C2 L10 TA

ENVIRONMENTAL SAFETY\n\nIn addition to electrical hazards, there are other environmental issues that computer technicians must deal with on a regular basis. The health and safety of you and those around you should always be your highest priority. Recognizing potential environmental hazards and properly dealing with them in a safe manner is a critical responsibility for a CompTIA® A+® technician.\n\n| Category | Description |\n| --- | --- |\n| Trip hazards | A trip hazard is caused by putting any object in pathways where people walk. |\n| Lifting and carrying risks | Lifting a heavy object in the wrong way can damage your back or cause muscle strains and ligament damage. You may also drop the object and injure yourself or damage the object. Lifting and manual handling risks are not limited to particularly heavy objects. An object that is large or awkward to carry could cause you to trip over or walk into something else. An object that has sharp or rough edges or contains a hot or corrosive liquid could cause you to cut or hurt yourself. |\ntag: C2 L10 TA

TOXIC WASTE HANDLING\n\nThe conditions surrounding computer equipment can be an issue when there is a large number of airborne particles flowing in and around various devices. Contaminants can be either gaseous, such as ozone; particles, such as dust; or organic, which comes from, industrial processing of fossil fuels or plastics. There is also a risk of poisonous or corrosive chemicals leaking from faulty equipment. Special care must be taken in respect of the following device types:\n\n• CRT monitors: A cathode ray tube (CRT) is an older type of computer monitor. These are very heavy and bulky and can contain substantial amounts of hazardous materials, notably lead. They also contain a glass vacuum tube and high-voltage capacitors. While the tube is designed to be shatter resistant, it is still potentially very hazardous if dropped. The capacitors represent a high risk of electric shock.\n\n• Batteries: Swollen or leaking batteries from laptop computers or within cell phones. and tablets must be handled very carefully and stored within appropriate containers. Use gloves and safety goggles to minimize any risk of burns from corrosive material.\n\n• Electronic devices (PCs, cell phones, and tablets): Many components in electronic devices contain toxins and heavy metals, such as lead, mercury, and arsenic. These toxins may be present in batteries, in circuit boards, and in plastics used in the case. These toxins are harmful to human health if ingested and damaging to the environment. This means that you must not dispose of electronic devices as general waste in landfill or incinerators. If an electronic device cannot be donated for reuse, it must be disposed of through an approved waste management and recycling facility.\n\n• Toner kits and cartridges: Photocopier and laser printer toner is an extremely fine powder. The products in toner powder are not classed as hazardous to health but any dust in substantial concentration is a nuisance as it may cause respiratory tract irritation.\ntag: C2 L10 TA

GUIDELINES FOR WORKING SAFELY AMONG ENVIRONMENTAL HAZARDS\n\nHere are some guidelines to help you work safely when environmental hazards are present.\n\nENVIRONMENTAL SAFETY\nFollow these guidelines to work safely among environmental hazards:\n\n• When installing equipment, ensure that cabling is secured, using cable ties or cable management products if necessary. Check that cables running under a desk cannot be kicked out by a user's feet. Do not run cabling across walkways or, if there is no option but to do so, use a cord protector to cover the cabling.\n\n• When servicing equipment, do not leave devices (PC cases for instance) in walkways or near the edge of a desk (where it could be knocked off). Be careful about putting down heavy or bulky equipment (ensure that it cannot topple).\n\n• When you need to lift or carry items, be aware of what your weight limitations are, as well as any restrictions and guidance set forth in your job description or site safety handbook. Weight limitations will vary depending on context. For example, a 50 pound limitation for lifting and carrying an object while holding it close to your body is not the same as lifting an object from a shelf above your head.\n\n• If necessary, you should obtain protective clothing (gloves and possibly goggles) for handling equipment and materials that can be hazardous.\n\n• To lift heavy object safely:\n1. Plant your feet around the object with one foot slightly toward the direction in which you are going to move.\n2. Bend your knees to reach the object while keeping your back as straight as is\npossible and comfortable and your chin up.\n3. Finda firm grip on the object then lift smoothly by straightening your legs—do not jerk the object up.\n4. Carry the object while keeping your back straight.\n\n• To lower an object, reverse the lifting process; keep your chin up and bend at the knees. Take care not to trap your fingers or to lower the object onto your feet.\n\n• If you cannot lift an object because it is too awkward or heavy, then get help from a coworker, or use a cart to relocate the equipment. If you use a cart, make sure the equipment is tightly secured during transport. Do not stack loose items on a cart. If you need to carry an object for some distance, make sure that the route is unobstructed and that the pathway (including stairs or doorways) is wide and tall enough.\n\n• Follow these guidelines when working with toxic materials.\no Never disassemble a CRT and never try to stack old units on top of one another.\no Use gloves and safety goggles to minimize any risk of burns from corrosive materials from batteries, cell phones, and tablets.\no Use an air filter mask that fits over your mouth and nose when servicing toner kits and cartridges to avoid breathing in the particles. People who suffer from asthma or bronchit is should avoid changing toner cartridges where possible. Loose toner must be collected carefully using an approved toner vacuum and sealed within a strong plastic waste container. Get the manufacturer's advice about disposing of loose toner safely. It must not be sent directly to a landfill.\ntag: C2 L10 TA

ESD\n\nStatic electricity is a high voltage (potential difference) stored in an insulated body. Electrostatic discharge (ESD) occurs when a path is created that allows electrons to rush from a statically charged body to another with an unequal charge. The electricity is released with a spark. The charge follows the path of least resistance, so it can occur between an electrical ground, such as a doorknob or a computer chassis, and a charged body, such as a human hand.\n\nAlthough the voltage is high, the amount of ESD current sustained is very low, so static electricity is not that harmful. It can, however, be slightly painful. You might have felt a small shock when reaching for a metal door handle for instance. You can feel a discharge of over about 2500V. A discharge of 20,000V or more could produce a visible spark. Walking over an untreated carpet in dry conditions could create a charge of around 35,000V.\n\nThe human body is mostly water and so does not generate or store static electricity very well. Unfortunately, our clothes are often made of synthetic materials, such as nylon and polyester, which act as good generators of static electricity and provide insulating layers that allow charges to accumulate. Humidity and climate also affect the likelihood of ESD. The risk increases during dry, cool conditions when humidity is low. In humid conditions, such as before or during a storm, the residual charge can bleed into the environment before it can increase sufficiently to be harmful to electrical components.\n\nAn electronic component, such as a memory or logic chip, is composed of fine, conductive metal oxides deposited on a small piece of silicon. Its dimensions are measured in fractions of a micron (one millionth of a meter). Any static electricity discharged into this structure will flash-over (spark) between the conductive tracks, damaging or even vaporizing them. A transistor designed to work with 1-3V can be damaged by a charge of under 100V, though most have ESD protection circuits that improve this tolerance.\n\nA static discharge may make a chip completely unusable. If not, it is likely to fail at some later time. Damage occurring in this way can be hidden for many months and might only manifest itself in occasional failures.\ntag: C2 L10 TA

COMPONENT HANDLING\n\nBy eliminating unnecessary activities that create static charges and by removing unnecessary materials that are known charge generators, you can protect against ESD-related damage and injuries. There are several other prevention techniques that you can use to protect yourself and equipment when you are working with computer components.\n\n• Self-grounding, or manual dissipation of static buildup by touching a grounded object prior to touching any electronic equipment. You can accomplish this by touching an unpainted part of a metal computer chassis or other component.\n\n• Using an anti-ESD wrist strap or leg strap can dissipate static charges more effectively than self-grounding, The band should fit snugly around your wrist or ankle to maximize contact with the skin. Do not wear it over clothing. The strap ground is made either using a grounding plug that plugs into a wall socket or a crocodile clip that attaches to a grounded point or an unpainted part of the computer's metal chassis.\n\n[file:///fig-507a.png]\nElectrostatic Discharge ESD wrist strap on ESD mat. (Image by Audrius Merfeldas © 123RF.com)\n\n• An anti-ESD service mat is also useful. Sensitive components can be placed on the mat safely. The mats contain a snap that you connect to the wrist or leg strap. If the technician's clothing has the potential to produce static charges, an ESD smock, which covers from the waist up, can be helpful.\n\n[file:///fig-507b.png]\nAn example of a basic electrostatic discharge (ESD) workstation. (Image © 123RF.com)\n\n• Electronic components, assemblies, and spare parts, known as field replaceable units (FRUs) are often shipped in antistatic bags to protect them from ESD damage.\n\nANTISTATIC BAG TYPES\nAntistatic packaging includes either anti-ESD shielding or dissipative material.\n\n• Anti-ESD Shielding—this packaging reduces the risk of ESD because it is coated with a conductive material (such as a nickel compound). This material prevents static electricity from discharging through the inside of the bag. These bags are usually a shiny grey metallic color. To protect the contents of the bag fully, you should seal it, or at least fold the top over and seal that down.\n\n• Dissipative Packaging—this light pink or blue packaging reduces the build-up of static in the general vicinity of the contents by being slightly more conductive than normal. A plastic bag or foam packaging may be sprayed with an anti-static coating or have anti-static materials added to the plastic compound. This is used to package non-static-sensitive components packed in proximity to static-sensitive components.\ntag: C2 L10 TA

GUIDELINES FOR PROTECTING COMPONENTS FROM ESD DAMAGE\n\nHere are some guidelines to help you protect your electronic components from ESD damage.\n\nESD PROTECTION\n\nFollow these guidelines to protect electronic components from damage due to ESD:\n\n• Use proper component handling and storage procedures whenever you are performing PC maintenance work.\n\n• To protect components and equipment from ESD damage:\n\no Make sure that your body and clothing are drained of static electricity before starting work.\n\no If possible, work in an uncarpeted area.\n\no The simplest (but least effective) means of self-grounding is to touch an unpainted metal part of the PC, such as the power supply unit, before you handle a sensitive component. This is only a temporary solution and a static charge could build up again.\n\nCaution: Do not leave the PC plugged in if you open the case for servicing. Your safety is more important than the risk of damaging some PC components.\n\no Where possible, handle vulnerable components by holding the edges of the\nplastic mounting card, and avoid touching the surfaces of the chips themselves.\n\n• Use ESD wrist or ankle straps and dissipative floor mats.\n\nNote: Ensure that the strap has @ working current-limiting resistor for safety (straps should be tested daily). Do not use a grounding plug if there is any suspicion of a fault in the socket or in the building's electrical wiring, or ifthe wiring is not regularly inspected and tested.\ntag: C2 L10 TA

Topic B\nEnvironmental Impacts and Controls\n\nEXAM OBJECTIVES COVERED\n1002-4.3 Given a scenario, implement basic disaster prevention and recovery methods.\n1002-4.5 Explain environmental impacts and appropriate controls.\n\nWhile you explored personal safety previously, there is also the issue of environmental impacts on computer systems to consider. Computers need stable power supplies and are sensitive to excessive heat. As a CompTIA A+ technician, you must understand the use of controls to ensure the proper environmental conditions for IT systems.\ntag: C2 L10 TB

POWER ISSUES\n\nEnvironmental power problems such as surges, brownouts, and blackouts are caused by failures in the building power supply, rather than failures in the computer's power supply unit, AC adapter, or battery pack.\n\nSURGES\nA surge is an abrupt but brief change in the value of the voltage. It can last from a few billionths of a second (a transient) to a few thousandths of a second. A spike is a powerful surge, such as that caused by a lightning storm. A surge or spike can be caused by high power devices, such as machinery, being turned on or off. Many surges are very small and of too short a duration to cause problems, but some can take the supply several hundred volts over its normal value and cause sufficient interference to a computer's power supply to crash, reboot, or even damage it.\n\nSAGS/BROWNOUTS\nSome electrically powered devices require very high starting, or inrush, current. These include items with large motors, such as lifts, washing machines, or power tools, and transformers. When this kind of device is turned on, the large current surge into the device may cause the available voltage within the locality to dip for a brief period, causing a sag. Sags may also be caused by the switching of power distribution circuits by the generating companies. A power sag may only last for a few milliseconds but sags of longer than about 10 to 20 milliseconds can cause computer equipment to malfunction. Ifa sag lasts for longer than a second, it is often called a brownout. Overloaded or faulty building power distribution circuits sometimes cause brownouts.\n\nBLACKOUTS\nAcomplete power failure is called a blackout. A blackout may be caused by a disruption to the power distribution grid—an equipment failure or the accidental cutting of a cable during construction work, for example—or may simply happen because a fuse has blown or a circuit breaker has tripped.\n\nPOWER PROTECTION CONTROLS\n\nComputing devices of all types, including client systems, network appliances, and servers, require a stable power supply to operate. Electrical events such as voltage spikes or surges can crash computers and network appliances, while loss of power  from brownouts or blackouts will cause equipment to fail. A range of power protection devices is available to mitigate these issues.\n\nSURGE PROTECTOR\nPassive protection devices can be used to filter out the effects of spikes and surges. The simplest surge protector or suppression devices come in the form of adapters, trailing sockets, or filter plugs, with the protection circuitry built into the unit. These devices offer low-cost protection to one or two pieces of equipment. Surge protectors are rated according to various national and international standards, including Underwriters Laboratory (UL) 1449, There are three important characteristics:\n\n• Clamping voltage—defines the level at which the protection circuitry will activate, with lower voltages (400 V or 300 V) offering better protection.\n\n• Joules rating—the amount of energy the surge protector can absorb, with 600 joules or more offering better protection. Each surge event will degrade the capability of the suppressor.\n\n• Amperage—the maximum current that can be carried, or basically the number of\ndevices you can attach. As a general rule of thumb, you should only use 80% of the rated capacity. For example, the devices connected to a 15 A protector should be drawing no more than 12 A. Of course, for domestic wiring, you should take care Not to overload the building's power circuits in any case.\n\nLINE CONDITIONERS\nLarger industrial power filter units called line conditioners or Power Distribution Units (PDUs) can be used to protect entire power circuits from the effects of surges or brownouts, but they are unable to remove or reduce the effects of blackouts.\n\nBATTERY BACKUPS AND UPS:\nPower redundancy means deploying systems to ensure that equipment is protected against blackout events so that both system and network operations can either continue uninterrupted or be recovered quickly. If there is loss of power, system operation can be sustained for a few minutes or hours, depending on load, by using battery backup. Battery backup can be provisioned at the component level for disk drives, RAID arrays, and memory modules. The battery protects any read or write operations cached at the time of power loss.\n\nAt the system level, an Uninterruptible Power Supply (UPS) will provide a temporary power source in the event of complete power loss. The time allowed by a UPS is sufficient to activate an alternative power source, such as a standby generator. If there is no alternative power source, a UPS will at least allow you to shut down the server or appliance properly. Users can save files and the operating system can complete the proper shutdown routines.\n\n[file:fig-513.png]\nExample of a UPS. (Image by magraphics© 123RF.com.)\n\nUPS SIZING\nIn its simplest form, a UPS comprises a bank of batteries and their char an inverter to generate AC voltage from the DC voltage supplied by the batteries. The capacity of the battery cells determines the amount of run-time a UPS can supply to any given load. This may range from a few minutes for a desktop-rated model to hours for an enterprise system. The power supplies in the computer equipment are connected to the ports on the UPS, then the UPS is connected to building power. There may also be a USB connection to facilitate monitoring and automated shutdown.\n\nFactors to consider when purchasing a UPS include reliability, cost, uptime, maintenance, and system performance and features. Different UPS models support different power outputs and form factors, such as desktop or rack mounted, depending upon your needs. Determining an appropriate UPS to protect the load from agiven system is called UPS sizing.\n\nThe maximum power rating (and hence cost) of a UPS is determined by the battery specification and the power handling of the inverter and other circuitry. Each UPS is rated according to the maximum VA (power) it can supply without overloading.\n\n[file:///fig-514a.png]\nChoosing the UPS—defining the computer and peripherals.\n\nTo calculate the required VA rating for a UPS, simply add up the VA ratings of all the equipment to be connected to the unit. These may be calculated by taking the number of watts used by each device and multiplying by 1.67.\n\nNote: The 1.67 conversion factor is required because the power drawn by a component ina DC circuit is not the same as the power required from the AC circuit. This is caused by the operation of the capacitors in the PC power supply unit.\n\nMost UPS vendor websites have a configuration wizard, which you can complete to determine what the power output you require is and the UPS models that would sul You can also specify the maximum duration of battery power (10 minutes, for instance), which enables you to determine how much charge the unit must be able to hold to supply your needs.\n\n[file:///fig-514b.png]\nDefining the power requirements.\ntag: C2 L10 TB

ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACTS\n\nThe environment in which computer equipment is kept can affect its proper operation and lifespan. All electronic equipment should be kept away from extremes of temperature and damp or dusty conditions. Regular inspection and cleaning of a PC's components and inspection of its surroundings may increase the Mean Time Between Failure (MTBF) of many components.\ntag: C2 L10 TB

DUST AND DEBRIS\n\nDust (airborne particles) is drawn into the computer via ventilation holes. Over the dust can form a thick layer over components and ventilation slots, preventing effective heat dissipation. It can clog up peripherals such as keyboards and mice. Dust and smears can make the display hard to read.\n\nDust can be controlled by cleaning, but you can also deploy controls to ensure that the surrounding environment is clean. Many buildings have environmental control systems with filters that can reduce the amount of dust in the air.\n\nThe PC chassis may be designed to protect internal components from airborne particles. For example, fan inlets can be protected by air or dust filters. These polyester sheets trap dust on their surface. If using filters, make sure they are cleaned or replaced periodically or they will clog up and prevent air circulating in the PC.\n\nIf the environment is particularly dusty, the whole PC can be placed within an enclosure with its own air filters and fans.\ntag: C2 L10 TB

TEMPERATURE, HUMIDITY, AND VENTILATION\n\nExcessive heat can make a computer unreliable. Computers generate plenty of heat just by running, Obviously a personal computer will be situated in an environment where the temperature is comfortable for humans (around 20°C/68°F). Do check the precise location of the PC though—direct sunlight or proximity to a radiator can cause heat to build up too easily. You must ensure that there is space for air to flow around the case, especially around the ventilation slots.\n\nHigh humidity—the amount of water vapor in the air—can cause condensation to form. On the other hand, low humidity allows static charges to build up more easily and increases the risk of Electrostatic Discharge (ESD). The ideal level is around 50%. Condensation can form as a result of sudden warming. When installing new equipment that has just been delivered, it is important to leave it in its packaging for a few hours— depending on the outside temperature—to allow it to adjust to room temperature gradually.\n\nHeating, Ventilation, Air Conditioning (HVAC) system ensures adequate cooling and humidity and dust contro! within a room or other enclosed space. All air flow into and out of the room is run through ducts, fans, and filters and warmed or cooled to the correct temperature and humidity.\ntag: C2 L10 TB

GENERAL PREVENTIVE MAINTENANCE\n\nRegular maintenance can increase the lifespan of equipment, but can also be time-consuming. You may want to consider providing cleaning materials and procedures to users and training them to perform these tasks themselves. To ensure that these tasks are performed regularly, you can also provide them with a schedule as suggested in the following table.\n\n| Frequency | Checks |\n| --- | --- |\n| Daily | • Check that nothing is obstructing the ventilation slots of the system unit. |\n| | • Check that the equipment is installed securely—for example, not positioned near desk edges, no cable trip hazards, no overloaded power points, no damaged cabling, and so on. |\n| | • Also ensure that there are no liquid hazards (chance of spills). |\n| Weekly | • Clean the exterior of the monitor and system unit. |\n| | • Clean the keyboard and mouse. |\n| Monthly | • Check that fans are functioning correctly. |\n| | • Check that all cables are correctly seated and secured to the system unit and peripherals. |\n\nIt Is important to control the build-up of dust (and clean up spills), but it is also important not to use household cleaning products for PC maintenance. Do not blow away dust with your mouth, as moisture may land on electronic components!\n\nNote: Always power off the computer and disconnect any devices before cleaning them.\n\nMASK AND GLOVES\nA mask that fits over your mouth and nose should be worn when you are using a compressed air canister, working around toner spills, or working in an otherwise dusty environment. A mask minimizes the risk of inhaling damaging airborne particles. You should also wear latex gloves when cleaning up a toner spill.\n\nCOMPRESSED AIR\nUse a compressed air blaster to dislodge dust from difficult to reach areas. Take care with use, however, as you risk contaminating the environment with dust. Ideally, perform this sort of maintenance within a controlled work area and wear an appropriate air filter mask. Also consider wearing safety goggles to minimize the risk of irritating your eyes with dust.\n\nNote: Do not use compressed air blasters to clean up a toner spill o a laser printer within an office-type area. You will blow fine toner dust into the atmosphere and create a health hazard.\n\nUse caution when working with compressed air. Read the instructions on the can and follow them carefully. Tipping the can too much can cause the propellant to leave the can in liquid form and at sub-freezing temperatures. The freezing could easily damage components, particularly those that may still be hot from use. There is also the issue of the corrosiveness of the chemical damaging components later on. Also, some delicate components on the motherboard can be damaged—literally blown off the board—if, compressed air is used too close to a component.\n\nVACUUMS\nUse a PC vacuum cleaner or natural bristle brush to remove dust from inside the system unit, especially from the motherboard, adapter cards, and fan assemblies. Home appliances should not be used, as they can produce high levels of static electricity. PC-safe vacuums can often be used to blow air as well as for suction, so they can replace the need for compressed air canisters for blowing dust out of machines.\n\nSucking the dust up is usually better, though, since blowing the dust can cause it to get onto or into other components.\n\nNote: A PC vacuum can be used to deal with toner spills ifthe filter and bag are fine enough to contain toner particles. Such vacuums should be labeled "toner safe." Ideally, move the printer to a maintenance room with filters to contain airborne particles. Alternatively, a toner cloth is a special cloth that you stretch that picks up toner particles that are either in the printer or around the printer. Be careful if you are using it inside the printer so that the cloth does not get caught on any components and leave fibers behind.\n\nPERIPHERAL DEVICE AND LAPTOP MAINTENANCE\n\nPeripheral and mobile devices receive the most wear and tear and require the most regular cleaning to keep them working properly.\n\nThere are several types of wipes and cloths that you can use to clean displays, keyboards, and other equipment. These use an appropriate cleaning solution for the type of plastic or surface coating that you are cleaning. They should also be non- abrasive and lint-free so that cleaning does not cause scratches or leave behind stray fibers.\n\nMOUSE\nMice suffer from build-up of grease and dust around the buttons and scroll wheel and need regular cleaning, To ensure that the mouse functions correctly, you should use it on a clean, flat surface, such as that provided by a proper mouse mat.\n\nKEYBOARD\nEnsure that keyboards are not used in an environment where food and beverages are present, as spillage of these substances can cause the keyboard to malfunction and make it difficult to clean. You can use a compressed air canister, PC vacuum cleaner, or natural bristle brush to clean debris from a keyboard then wipe down the surfaces with a lint-free cloth and approved cleaner. Tightly wound cotton swabs or toothpicks are useful when trying to get dust and debris out from between keys and around buttons or other tight areas.\n\nDISPLAY\nThe display screen should be kept clean and free of smears to avoid eyestrain when using the computer for prolonged periods. If the screen requires more than dusting, use an approved display screen cleaner, spraying the cleaner onto the cloth or pad, not onto the screen. You can also obtain pre-moistened wipes. You must use approved cleaning products and a non-abrasive cloth to avoid damaging the screen's anti-glare coating, The products are also formulated to provide anti-static protection against further dust buildup. When cleaning the screen, wipe horizontally across the screen and then vertically. Do not forget to clean into the screen corners.\n\nLAPTOP MAINTENANCE ISSUES\nLaptops are typically used in dirtier environments than desktops. Despite the name, it is important to encourage users to put the laptop on a firm, flat surface during use, to allow the cooling fan and vent on the bottom to work properly. These vents should be cleaned regularly using a PC-approved vacuum cleaner or compressed air. For actual "laptop" use, it is best to provide a chiller pad or mat to provide air flow and (with active chiller pads) extra USB-powered fans for cooling.\n\nCompressed air can also be used to clean the keyboard. The screen, touchpad, and case can be cleaned using a soft cloth and approved cleaning solution.\ntag: C2 L10 TB

DISPOSAL, RECYCLING, AND COMPLIANCE\n\nEven with procedures in place to properly maintain IT equipment, eventually it will need to be decommissioned and either disposed of or recycled. IT equipment contains numerous components and materials that can cause environmental damage if they are disposed of as ordinary refuse.\n\nCOMPLIANCE AND GOVERNMENTAL REGULATIONS\nIn the United States and many other nations, your employer is obligated to comply with governmental regulations that apply to its specific business. The most common regulations are those issued by the federal government, such as the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), and state standards regarding employee safety. OSHA-compliant employers must provide:\n\n• A workplace that is free from recognized hazards that could cause serious physical harm.\n\n• Personal protective equipment designed to protect employees from certain hazards.\n\n• Communication—in the form of labeling, Material Safety Data Sheets (MSDSs), and training about hazardous materials.\n\nYour responsibility—to yourself, your employer, your coworkers, and your customers—is to be informed of potential hazards and to always use safe practices.\n\nProtection of the environment is another area that is regulated by the federal and local governments in the United States and many other nations. Many municipalities have regulations that control the disposal of certain types of computer equipment. Your responsibility is to be aware of any environmental controls that are applicable to your workplace, and to be in compliance with those regulations.\n\nMaterials safety and environmental legislation require that environmental hazards be disposed of correctly. In the US, environmental matters are the responsibility of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).\n\nMSDS DOCUMENTATION\nEmployers are obliged to assess the risk to their workforce from hazardous substances, at work and to take steps to eliminate or control that risk. No work with hazardous substances should take place unless an assessment has been made. Employees are within their rights to refuse to work with hazardous substances that have not been assessed.\n\nSuppliers of chemicals are required to identify the hazards associated with the substances they supply. Some hazard information will be provided on labels, but the supplier must also provide more detailed information on a Material Safety Data Sheet (MSDS).\n\nAn MSDS will contain information about:\n\n• Ingredients.\n\n• Health hazards, precautions, and first aid information.\n\n• What to do if the material is spilled or leaks.\n\n• How to recycle any waste product or dispose of it safely.\n\nYou may need to refer to an MSDS in the course of handling monitors, power supplies, batteries, laser printer toner, and cleaning products. If handling devices that are broken or leaking, use appropriate protective gear, such as gloves, safety goggles, and an air filter mask.\n\n[file:///fig-519.png]\nAn example of MSDS documentation.\ntag: C2 L10 TB

Topic C\nCreate and Maintain Documentation\n\nEXAM OBJECTIVES COVERED\n1002-4.1 Compare and contrast best practices associated with types of documentation.\n\nThere are many reasons for creating and maintaining documentation. A big reason is. so that in case of a disaster, you already have critical documentation in place that will help you rebuild as quickly as possible, Without detailed documentation, you would have to rely on memory to determine your network layout, which would likely be very time consuming, costly, and ultimately inaccurate. A complete set of configuration documentation will give you a solid base from which you can begin rebuilding individual workstations, servers, and your network.\n\nYou should also document organizational policies. By identifying common organizational policies and procedures that deal with computer use, you will be more capable of dealing with compliance issues as they arise and protecting organizational resources.\ntag: C2 L10 TC

EQUIPMENT INVENTORY\n\nIt is crucial for an organization to have a well-documented inventory of its tangible and intangible assets and resources. This should include all hardware that is currently deployed as well as spare systems and components kept on hand in case of component or system failure. In terms of network management, these will include network appliances (routers, switches, threat management devices, access points), servers, workstations, and passive network infrastructure (cabling and cross-connects).\n\nThere are many software suites and associated hardware solutions available for tracking and managing assets (or inventory). An asset management database can be configured to store as much or as little information as is deemed necessary, though typical data would be type, model, serial number, asset ID, location, user(s), value, and. service information. Tangible assets can be identified using a barcode label or Radi Frequency ID (RFID) tag attached to the device (or more simply using an identification number). An RFID tag is a chip programmed with asset data. When in range of a scanner, the chip powers up and signals the scanner. The scanner alerts management software to update the device's location. As well as asset tracking, this allows the management software to track the location of the device, making theft more difficult. For each asset record there should also be a copy of or link to the appropriate vendor documentation, This would include both an invoice and warranty/support contract and support and troubleshooting guidance.\n\nIT asset management is the set of management policies that include information about the financial and contractual specifications of all the hardware and software components present in an organization's inventory. Some organizations have exclusive asset management for hardware and software components. As part of inventory management, use the system life cycle to determine whether the items in the inventory need to be retired or replaced. Use proper asset disposal methods when removing assets from inventory. Critical hardware and software inventory provides insurance documentation and helps determine what you need to rebuild the network.\n\n| Inventory Entry | Hardware/Software | Information to Include |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Standard workstation | Hardware | A basic description of a standard client workstation. Include minimum requirements and the installed operating system as well as how many workstations of this type are deployed. For workstations that deviate from the norm, be sure to document the deviations. |\n| Specialty workstation | Hardware | A description of any specialty workstations deployed. Include a brief description of their roles and special configurations implemented on them. |\n| Server | Hardware | A list of the basic server hardware configuration and the role of these servers. List their internal hardware and any special configuration settings and software. Include a configuration list for the operating system. |\n| Connectivity hardware | Hardware | A list of all connectivity hardware in as much detail as possible. This includes the device brand and model numbers, but a description of each feature ensures that replacements can be made without research. |\n| Backup hardware | Hardware | Document critical information about backup hardware, such as the vendor and model number of a tape drive, backup hard drives, DVD drives, and network attached storage, if applicable. |\n| Operating system  software | Software | All operating system software, including desktop and server operating systems. Include documentation on licensing and copies of the bulk licenses, if possible. Many vendors retain records of software licenses sold to their customers. If this is the case, include this fact in your documentation. |\n| Productivity and application software | Software | Off-the-shelf productivity software, including any applications installed on client devices and servers. |\n|  Maintenance utilities | Software | The utilities used to maintain a network, especially backup software and software configuration. |\n| Backup documentation | Software | Records of when backups were made, how frequently to make them, what backups contain, where backups are stored, and credentials needed to restore backups. Document the backup software and version. Special setup and configuration considerations need to be documented, too. |\n| Overall asset inventory | Software | If your company maintains an overall asset inventory, attach a copy. Many companies use the inventory as a base to track hardware and maintenance. This usually includes most of the information needed. |\ntag: C2 L10 TC

NETWORK TOPOLOGY DIAGRAMS\n\nDiagrams are the best way to capture the complex relationships between network elements. They are also the most effective means of locating particular items within the network. Diagrams can be used to model physical and logical relationships at different levels of scale and detail. These relationships are described as the network topology.\n\nSCHEMATIC BLOCK DIAGRAM\nA schematic is a simplified representation of the network topology. In terms of the physical network topology, it can show the general placement of equipment and telecommunications rooms plus device and port IDs without trying to capture the exact position or relative size of any one element. Schematics can also be used to represent the logical structure of the network in terms of security zones, VLANs, and subnets.\n\nSchematics can either be drawn manually using a tool such as Microsoft® Visio® or compiled automatically from network mapping software.\n\n[file:///fig-523.png]\nUse a tool such as Visio f0 create network diagrams.\ntag: C2 L10 TC

REFERENCE DOCUMENTATION\n\nThere are several types of documentation and resources that you might find helpful, When you are dealing with common hardware and operating system problems. You can also share documentation and resources with users as a means of assisting and educating them.\n\n| Resource | Description |\n| --- | --- |\n| User/installation manuals | User and installation manuals can provide you with basic  guidance for installing, configuring, and troubleshooting hardware and software. |\n| | By providing users with various user and installation manuals, users can fix minor issues and problems before requesting additional assistance from a technician. |\n| | Examples include installing company-specific applications, installing network printers, and mapping drives. |\n| Internet/web-based resources | Internet and web-based resources can provide a wealth of information on installing, configuring, and troubleshooting, hardware and software. Many hardware and software manufacturers maintain knowledge bases (KBs) and wikis to share information about both common and unusual issues that can arise with PC hardware and software. |\n| | Articles written by industry leaders, by support professionals, and by vendors can be a good source of information. Be sure to take into consideration who wrote the article and any verifiable credentials so you can, determine the legitimacy of the article content. |\n| | Internet and web-based materials can also provide users with quick reference materials for dealing with everyday issues on their own. Some organizations provide a web page or wiki with user-specific information and reference materials. |\n| Training materials | Most major hardware and software manufacturers provide training materials on how to install and use their products. These materials can be helpful for both new and experienced technicians. |\n| | You can provide training materials for various tasks that users may need to complete on their own, such as virus scans, computer maintenance tasks, and PC clean-up tasks. By providing training materials, you empower users to be proactive in maintaining their systems. |\ntag: C2 L10 TC

INCIDENT DOCUMENTATION\n\nA piece of software that can be considered part of your support toolkit is a tracking database where incidents that occur can be documented. There are different kinds of incidents, with different reporting requirements. One type of incident is for troubleshooting or support requests. Each support incident will be logged as a job or ticket within the incident management system. The following information will form the core of a job ticket:\n\n| Information | Notes |\n| Job ID Contact | Job IDs are often referred to as tickets. |\n| | Name, organization, department, email address, telephone number. In a database, the job could be linked to a contact record. |\n| Priority | Assessed from caller's description and customer's service level. |\n| Problem description | Including information about platform (hardware, 0S, application [including version and update number), and what the user was doing. |\n| Asset | Hardware component or software application associated with the problem, linked to an asset management database. |\n| Details | What was attempted during the first contact. |\n| Follow up Dates | Date and description of follow up actions. |\n| |  Dates when the ticket was opened, updated, and closed. |\n\nSecurity incident reporting needs to capture some of the same information but will normally be handled by a dedicated security response team. Reports of actual or suspected security policy violations will initially be processed by a first responder. The report will log the location and time of the incident plus systems affected and the actors and methods used to perform the intrusion. It is important to identify whether any data breach has occurred and what sort of notification must be made for regulatory or compliance purposes. The contents of security incident reports must be kept confidential and access granted on a need-to-know basis only.\n\n[file:///fig-525.png]\nSample incident report.\n\nAccidents represent another type of incident reporting requirement. An accident is, any instance where a person is injured or computer equipment is damaged due to environmental issues. The report is also used for accidents involving hazardous materials, such as chemical spills, that could have an impact on the environment. Any time an accident occurs at a work site, you should submit an incident report. Reporting these occurrences is often part of company policy and can help provide protection against liability.\n\nIncident documentation might use a simple spreadsheet or database, or it might be a complex help desk management tracking application; it all depends on the needs of your organization. Incident management includes the practices and procedures that govern how an organization will respond to an incident in progress.\ntag: C2 L10 TC

ORGANIZATIONAL POLICIES\n\nAs a vital component of a company's IT infrastructure, employees must understand how to use computers and networked services securely and safely and be aware of, their responsibilities. To support this, the organization needs to create written policies and procedures to help staff understand and fulfill their responsibilities and follow best practice.\n\nSTANDARDS, PROCEDURES, AND GUIDANCE\nA policy is an overall statement of intent. In order to establish the correct working practices, three different mechanisms can be put in place.\n\n| Policy Type | Description |\n| --- | --- |\n| Standard  | A standard is a measure by which to evaluate compliance with the policy. |\n| Procedure | A procedure, often referred to as a Standard Operating Procedure (SOI an inflexible, step-by-step listing of the actions that must be completed for any given task. Most critical tasks should be governed by SOPs. |\n| Guidelines | Guidelines exist for areas of policy where there are no procedures, either because the situation has not been fully assessed or because the decision making process is. too complex and subject to variables to be able to capture itin a procedure. Guidelines may also describe circumstances where it is appropriate to deviate from a specified procedure. |\n\nPOLICY ENFORCEMENT\nit is not enough to just have standards and policies. Your organization and its employees and contractors need to adhere to them as well. For employees and contractors, this requires that they read the standards and policies, and understand, that they need to follow them. For the organization, it also needs to follow the standards and policies, regardless of who is acting on the organization's behalf. In addition, the organization may also have regulatory compliance and additional adherence to laws, regulations, guidelines, and specifications relevant to its business. Violations of regulatory compliance regulations often result in legal punishment, including federal fines.\n\nPERSONNEL MANAGEMENT POLICIES\nHuman Resources (HR) is the department tasked with recruiting and managing the organization's most valuable and critical resource: people. Personnel management policies can be conceived as applying in three phases.\n\n| Phase | Description |\n| --- | --- |\n| Recruitment or hiring | Recruitment involves locating then selecting and hiring people to wor particular job roles. Security issues here include screening candidates and performing background checks. |\n| Operation or working | It Is often the HR department that manages the communication of policy and training to employees, though there may be a separate training and personal development department within larger organizations. As such, it is critical that HR managers devise training programs that communicate the importance of security to employees. |\n| Termination or separation | Whether an employee leaves voluntarily or involuntarily, termination is a difficult process, with numerous security implications. An employee might be fired, retired, or simply be moving on to another job at another organization. |\n\nOperational policies include privilege management, data/information handling, incident response, and use of company devices and services such as Internet access. One function of HRs to draft and communicate these written policies to employees, including any updates to the policies. Another function is to enforce disciplinary measures, perhaps in conjunction with departmental managers.\n\nPASSWORD POLICIES\nA password policy defines standards for creating password complexity. It also defines what an organization considers weak passwords and the guidelines for protecting password safety. It specifies standards such as avoiding common passwords, how to create strong passwords, and rules for not using work-related passwords for other sites or services.\n\nACCEPTABLE USE POLICIES\nAn Acceptable Use Policy (AUP), or Fair Use Policy, sets out what someone is allowed to use a particular service or resource for. Such a policy might be used in different contexts. For example, an AUP could be enforced by a business to govern how employees use equipment and services such as telephone or Internet access. provided to them at work. Another example might be an ISP enforcing a fair use policy governing usage of its Internet access services. Enforcing an acceptable use policy is. important to protect the organization from the security and legal implications of employees (or customers) misusing its equipment. Typically, the policy will forbid the use of equipment to defraud, defame, or to obtain illegal material. it is also likely to prohibit the installation of unauthorized hardware or software and to explicitly forbid actual or attempted intrusion (snooping). An organization's acceptable use policy may forbid use of Internet tools outside of work-related duties or restrict such use to break times.\n\nAUPs often include policies for the items listed in the following table.\n\n| An AUP Policy for | Covers |\n| --- | --- |\n| Rules of Behavior | The equipment used to access the Internet in the workplace is owned by the employer. Many employees expect relatively unrestricted access to Internet facilities for personal use. In fact, employees’ use of social networking and file sharing poses substantial risks to the organization, including threat of virus infection or systems intrusion, lost work time, copyright infringement, and defamation. if an employee breaks copyright laws or libels someone using an organization's equipment, the organization itself could be held liable.\n| | To avoid confusion, an employee's handbook should set out the terms under which use of web browser/email/social networking/P2P software is permitted for personal use, and what penalties infringements could incur. Employers are within their rights to prohibit all private use of internet services. |\n| | Users should be aware that any data communications, such as email, made through an organization's computer system are liable to be stored within the system, on servers, backup devices, and so on. Consequently, employees should not use computers at work to send personal information, for their own security and privacy if nothing else. |\n| Use of Personally Owned Devices in the Workplace | Portable devices such as smartphones, USB thumb drives, media players, and so on pose a considerable threat to data security as they facilitate file copying. Camera and voice recording functions are other obvious security issues. |\n| | Network access control/endpoint security and data loss prevention solutions can be of some use in preventing the attachment of such devices to corporate networks. Some companies may try to prevent staff from bringing such devices on site, This is quite difficult to enforce, though. |\ntag: C2 L10 TC

GUIDELINES FOR CREATING AND MAINTAINING DOCUMENTATION\n\nHere are some guidelines to follow when creating and maintaining your documentation.\n\nCREATE AND MAINTAIN DOCUMENTATION\nConsider the following guidelines for creating and maintaining documentation.\n\n• Keep an accurate record of the equipment and software within the organization, including:\no Deployed hardware, both complete systems and components.\no Deployed software, both applications and operating systems.\no Spare hardware, both complete systems and components.\no Software that is not currently installed, both applications and operating systems.\n\n• Use asset tags, either printed barcodes or RFID tags, to track equipment.\n\n• Each asset record should include a copy of or link to the appropriate vendor documentation.\n\n• Document network components through the use of schematic block diagrams showing physical and logical network structure.\n\n• Maintain a library of reference documentation, including:\no User and installation manuals.\no Links to Internet and web-based resources.\no Training materials\n\n• Document incidents through the use of standardized incident reports.\n\n• Create and maintain organizational policies. This should include:\no Personnel management policies\no Policy on how to handle confidential information.\no Acceptable use policies.\ntag: C2 L10 TC

Topic D\nUse Basic Change Management Best Practices\n\nEXAM OBJECTIVES COVERED\n1002-4.2 Given a scenario, implement basic change management best practices.\n\nPractically every technical deployment will face unforeseen issues. The IT project team members should address unexpected changes by using a process that keeps stakeholders informed and that minimizes impact on the overall project, especially the project's timelines and goals.\ntag: C2 L10 TD

CHANGE MANAGEMENT\n\nConfiguration management means identifying all components of the information and communications technology (ICT) infrastructure (hardware, software, and procedures) and their properties. Change management means putting policies in place to reduce the risk that changes to these components could cause service disruption (network downtime).\n\nITIL CONFIGURATION MANAGEMENT MODEL\nIT Infrastructure Library (ITIL®) is a popular documentation of good and best practice\nactivities and processes for delivering IT services. Under ITIL, configuration management is implemented using the following elements:\n\n• Service assets are things, processes, or people that contribute to the delivery of an IT service.\n\n• A Configuration Item (CI) is an asset that requires specific management procedures for it to be used to deliver the service. Each CI must be identified by some sort of label. Cis are defined by their attributes, which are stored in a Configuration Management Database (CMDB).\n\n• Baseline is a fundamental concept in configuration management. The baseline represents "the way it was." A baseline can be a configuration baseline (the ACL applied to a firewall, for instance) or a performance baseline (such as the throughput achieved by a server).\n\n• A Configuration Management System (CMS) is the tools and databases that collect, store, manage, update, and present information about Cls. A small network might capture this information in spreadsheets and diagrams; there are dedicated applications for enterprise CMS.\n\nOne of the goals of the CMS is to understand the relationships between Cls. Another is to track changes to Cl attributes (and therefore variance from the baseline) over time. The purpose of documentation in terms of change and configuration management is as follows:\n\n• Identify each component (Cl) and label it.\n\n• Capture each Cl and its (relevant) attributes ina CMDB.\n\n• Capture relationships between Cis. This is best done using diagrams.\n\n• Capture changes to a Cl as a job log and update the CMDB.\n\nDOCUMENTING CHANGES\nEach individual system, server, and network component should have a separate document that describes its initial state and all subsequent changes. This document includes configuration information, a list of patches applied, backup records, and even. details about suspected breaches. Printouts of hash results, last modification dates of critical system files, and contents of log files may be pasted into this book. System maintenance can be made much smoother with a comprehensive change document. For instance, when a patch is available for an operating system, it typically applies in only certain situations. Manually investigating the applicability of a patch on every possible target system can be very time consuming; however, if logs are available for reference, the process is much faster and more accurate.\n\nNote: An example of change management documentation that you can use as a starting point when creating this document for your organization can be found at (https://www.sans.org/summit-archives/file/summit-archive-1493830822 pdf).\ntag: C2 L10 TD

DOCUMENTED BUSINESS PROCESSES\n\nDepending on the needs of your organization, you might need general business processes to be documented, or you might need every single thing that happens throughout the workday documented. The latter usually applies to businesses that need FDA or other governmental approval to produce and sell goods and services. At the minimum, you should document changes made to systems such as when a new employee comes on board or when an employee leaves and what happens to their hardware and software when those events occur. You will also want to document how various tasks are completed throughout the organization, including how systems are configured, how the network is configured, what criteria is required for making changes to any equipment that is deployed, how and when to replace equipment, and many other aspects of having an organization filled with computing devices.\n\nSOPs AND WORK INSTRUCTIONS\nThe main difficulty in implementing a workable configuration management system is in determining the level of detail that must be preserved. This is not only evident in capturing the asset database and configuration baseline in the first place, but also in managing Moves, Adds, and Changes (MACs) within the organization's computing, infrastructure. In terms of computing tasks, a CMS will require that configuration changes be made only when there is a valid job ticket authorizing the change. This means that the activity of all computer support personnel, whether it be installing new devices or troubleshooting, is recorded in job logs. In a fully documented environment, each task will be governed by some sort of procedure. Formal configuration management models often distinguish between two types of procedural documentation:\n\n• A Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) sets out the principal goals and considerations (such as budget, security, or customer contact standards) for performing a task and identifies lines of responsibility and authorization for performing it.\n\n• A Work instruction is step-by-step instructions for performing an installation or configuration task using a specific product or technology and credentials.\n\nCHANGE MANAGEMENT DOCUMENTATION\nTo reduce the risk that changes to configuration items will cause service disruption, a documented management process can be used to plan for change in a planned and controlled way. Change requests are usually generated when something needs to be corrected, new business needs or processes are identified, or there is room for improvement in a process or system currently in place. The need to change is often described either as reactive, where the change is forced on the organization, or as proactive, where the need for change is initiated internally. Changes can also be categorized according to their potential impact and level of risk (major, significant, minor, or normal, for instance).\n\nIn a formal change management process, the need or reasons for change and the procedure for implementing the change is captured in a Request for Change (RFC) document and submitted for approval.\n\nChange request documentation should include:\n\n• The purpose of the change.\n\n• The scope of the change.\n\n• A risk analysis of both performing the change and not performing the requested change.\n\n• A documented plan for carrying out the change.\n\n• A method to acquire end-user acceptance that the change was performed to their satisfaction and that the change was properly implemented.\n\n• A backout plan in case unforeseen problems arise when the change is made.\n\n• Document all changes that were made.\n\nCHANGE BOARD APPROVAL\nThe RFC will then be considered at the appropriate level and affected stakeholders will be notified. This might be a supervisor or department manager if the change is normal or minor. Major or significant changes might be managed as a separate project and require approval through a Change Advisory Board (CAB).\ntag: C2 L10 TD

PROCESS FOR INSTITUTING CHANGE TO OPERATIONAL POLICIES AND PROCEDURES\n\nRegardless of whether an organization is large enough to require formal change management procedures and staff, the implementation of changes should be carefully planned, with consideration for how the change will affect dependent components. For most significant or major changes, organizations should attempt a trial implementation of the change first. Every change should be accompanied by a rollback (or backout) plan, so that the change can be reversed if it has harmful or unforeseen consequences. Changes should also be scheduled sensitively if they are likely to cause system downtime or other negative impact on the workflow of the business units that depend on the IT system being modified. Most organizations have a scheduled maintenance window period for authorized downtime.\n\nWhen the change has been implemented, its impact should be assessed and the process reviewed and documented to identify any outcomes that could help future change management projects.\ntag: C2 L10 TD

GUIDELINES FOR USING CHANGE MANAGEMENT BEST PRACTICES\n\nHere are some best practices to follow regarding change management.\n\nUSE CHANGE MANAGEMENT BEST PRACTICES\nConsider these best practices guidelines for using change management.\n\n• Create a separate document for each individual system, server, and network component that describes its initial state and all subsequent changes. This document includes:\no Configuration information\no Applied patch list\no Record of backups\no Details about suspected security breaches\n\n• Configuration management using ITIL should be implemented using:\no Service assets\no Configuration items\no Configuration Management Database (CMDB)\no Baselines\no Configuration Management System\n\n• Document the need or desire for a change using an RFC document.\n\n• RFCs should be considered at the appropriate level and affected stakeholders notified.\n\n• Major or significant changes might be managed as a separate project and require approval through a Change Advisory Board (CAB).\n\n• Follow documented SOPs and Work Instructions when performing moves, adds, and changes.\n\n• Implementation of changes should be carefully planned, with consideration for how the change will affect dependent components.\n\n• For most significant or major changes, organizations should attempt to trial the change first.\n\n• Every change should be accompanied by a rollback (or remediation) plan.\n\n• Changes should also be scheduled sensitively if they are likely to cause system downtime or other negative impact on workflow.\n\n• When the change has been implemented, its impact should be assessed and the process reviewed and documented to identify any outcomes that could help future change management projects.\ntag: C2 L10 TD

Topic E\nImplement Disaster Prevention and Recovery Methods\n\nEXAM OBJECTIVES COVERED\n1002-4.3 Given a scenario, implement basic disaster prevention and recovery methods\n\nEnsuring that data, applications, client computers, servers, and other network resources are available to users is part of a computer technician's responsibilities. This can be challenging when hardware fails or a natural disaster strikes. In this topic, you will see how to implement measures related to disaster prevention and recovery.\ntag: C2 L10 TE

DISASTER PREVENTION AND RECOVERY\n\nA disaster could be anything from a fairly trivial loss of power or failure of a minor component to man-made or natural disasters, such as fires, earthquakes, or acts of terrorism. An organization sensitive to these risks will develop an effective, documented Disaster Recovery Plan (DRP). This should accomplish the following:\n\n• Identify scenarios for natural and man-made disasters and options for protecting systems.\n\n• Identify tasks, resources, and responsibilities for responding to a disaster.\n\n• Train staff in the disaster planning procedures and how to react well to change.\n\nWhen a disaster occurs, the failover recovery plan will swing into action to get the failed part of the network operational as soon as possible. If a disk has failed, swap it out. If a network component has failed, remove and replace or repair the component to provide for high reliability as soon as possible. If data becomes corrupted oF lost, utilize your restoration plan to recover the data.\ntag: C2 L10 TE

DATA BACKUP AND RESTORATION\n\nOne of the important tasks you will need to perform as an A+ technician is making sure that users’ data and system settings are being backed up in case things go awry.\n\nData backup is a system maintenance task that enables you to store copies of critical data for safekeeping. Backups protect against loss of data due to disasters such as file corruption or hardware failure. Data restoration is a system recovery task that enables you to access the backed-up data. Restored data does not include any changes made to the data after the backup operation. Data backups can be accomplished simply by copying individual files and folders to a local or network location or by using, dedicated software and hardware to back up large amounts of data.\n\nBackup operations can be performed at different levels:\n\n• File level—this is used to back up user-generated files stored in local profile folders or network shares. Almost all backup software can perform this basic task.\n\n• Image-level—this is used to back up an OS and can include third-party software applications, drivers, and custom settings installed under the OS. An image can be used both to restore physical computers and Virtual Machines (VM).\n\n• Critical applications—network applications often depend on some sort of database for storage rather than individual file-based storage. Specialist backup software is required to connect to the database. Backups can be made of the whole database or of individual tables and records.\n\nNote:  As well as the application data and settings, make sure you make a backup of product keys and license information. These might be required to restore the application license.\n\nMany devices and user accounts include cloud storage space. If you store your data in a cloud storage site, the onus of performing backups is left to the provider of the cloud space. This data is often also stored on your local storage device, so you have two copies already. Examples include photos and music stored on smart phones being, automatically copied to the platform's related cloud storage site such as iCloud® for Apple® devices and Google Drive™ for Android™ devices.\n\nBACKUP MANAGEMENT\nThe execution and frequency of backups must be carefully planned and guided by policies. Backups are kept back to certain points in time. As backups take up a lot of space, and there is never limitless storage capacity, this introduces the need for storage management routines and techniques to reduce the amount of data occupying backup storage media while giving adequate coverage of the required recovery window. The recovery window is determined by the Recovery Point Objective (RPO), which is determined through business continuity planning.\n\n[file:///fig-538.png]\nBacking up a domain controller using Acronis backup. The How Long to Keep field specifies the retention period. (Screenshot courtesy of acronis.com.)\n\nData retention needs to be considered in the short and long term:\n\n• In the short term, files that change frequently might need retaining for version control. Short term retention is also important in recovering from malware infection. Consider the scenario where a backup is made on Monday, a file is infected with a virus on Tuesday, and when that file is backed up later on Tuesday, the copy made on Monday is overwritten. This means that there is no good means of restoring the uninfected file.\n\n• In the long term, data may need to be stored to meet legal requirements or to comply with company policies or industry standards.\n\nA retention policy can either be based on redundancy (the number of copies of each file that should be retained) or on a recovery window (the number of days into the past that should be retained).\n\nBACKUP TYPES\nWhen considering a backup made against an original copy of data, the backup can usually be performed using one of three main types: full, incremental, or differential. In Windows®, a full backup includes all selected files and directories, whereas incremental and differential backups check the status of the archive attribute before including a file. The archive attribute is set whenever a file is modified. This allows backup software to determine which files have been changed and therefore need to be copied.\n\nNote: Linux doesn’t support a file archive attribute. Instead, a date stamp is used to determine whether the file has changed.\n\nThe following table summarizes the three different backup types.\n\n| Type | DataSelection | Backup/Restore Time | Archive Attribute |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Full | All selected data regardless of when it was previously backed up | High/low (one tape set) | Cleared |\n| Incremental | New files and files modified since last backup | Low/high (multiple tape sets) | Cleared |\n| Differential | All data modified since the last full backup | Moderate/moderate (no more than 2 sets) | Not Cleared |\n\nA typical strategy for a complex network would be a full weekly backup followed by an incremental or differential backup at the end of each day.\n\n• The advantage of using a full daily backup is that one tape set is only required to restore the system.\n\nThe advantage of an incremental backup is that it takes less time to back up, but several tape sets may need to be restored before the system is operational.\n\nThe advantage of a differential backup is the balance of time for both restoring and backing up.\n\nCaution: Do not combine differential and incremental backups. Use full backups interspersed with differential backups, or full backups interspersed with incremental backups.\n\nNote: Most software also has the capability to do copy backups. These are made outside the tape rotation system (ad hoc) and do not affect the archive attribute.\n\nRECOVERY IMAGES\nA custom recovery image contains the current state of the operating system files, plus all of the desktop applications installed to the boot partition. An image can be used to restore the OS and any critical applications to a workstation or VM in one step. A new image must be created if any additional applications are installed or configuration changes made.\n\nIf user account profiles are stored on the same partition or drive as the OS, this user data will be included in the image. As images take a relatively long time to create, it is better to back up user data separately using file level backups. User profiles or home folders might be stored on a network file server to make them easier to back up.\ntag: C2 L10 TE

BACKUP TESTING\n\nBefore you use a backup to restore data, test it to make sure it's reliable. To test the backup:\n\n• Try restoring some of the backed-up data into a test directory, making sure you don't overwrite any data when doing so.\n\n• Configure the backup software to verify after it writes.\n\n• Verify that the backup contains all the required files.\n\n• Test backup devices and media on a regular basis.\ntag: C2 L10 TE

OFF-SITE AND LOCAL STORAGE\n\nTypically, the backups you create are stored off-site. If disaster strikes the facility where your servers are located, you won't lose your backup media as well. You might want to keep a set of backup media on site as well, so that you have instant access to the backups in case files are accidentally deleted or corrupted. For off-site storage, you might use a bank safety deposit box for small organizations, or you might contract with a firm that specializes in securely storing backups. Cloud storage services provide an effective means of storing backed up data off-site. Specialist cloud backup providers allow the scheduling and data transfer all to be managed from the cloud console. For on-site storage, consider using a fireproof safe.\n\nWherever you decide to keep your backups, environmental considerations must be taken into account. Do not store the backups where there is high heat or humidity, which could damage the backup medium. Be sure not to store the backups near equipment with strong magnets that could erase the data and damage the backup media.\n\nBACKUP STORAGE SECURITY\nThere are various best practices for ensuring security of backup data. They include:\n\n• Authentication of users and backup clients to the backup server.\n\n• Role based access control lists for all backup and recovery operations.\n\n• Data encryption options for both backup transmission and storage.\n\n• Backup of remote clients to a centralized location behind firewalls.\n\n• Default data storage locations must be standardized.\n\n• Create a policy that defines where documents are backed up from.\n\n• Use segregation of duties enforced by policy for all personnel handling backup data.\n\n• Document all access, testing, backup, and restore cycles.\ntag: C2 L10 TE

ACCOUNT RECOVERY\n\nUsers are likely to have several different accounts to maintain, each with its own password and login name. Frequently, users will forget the password for an account or there may be some sort of fault preventing use of a smart card or biometric credentials. Usually to recover an account password, you will need to input the answers to one or more challenge questions and/or receive a token sent to another trusted device or email account.\n\nIf password recovery methods do not work, or if the account profile has been deleted or corrupted, you might need to recreate the account or set up a new account then.\n\nimport any backed up data and settings to the new account. Windows uses an SID to identify each account in file ACLs. If you recreate an account, it will not have the same SID and you will have to reconfigure file permissions and group memberships.\n\nNote: if an account profile is corrupted, the key required to decrypt files encrypted using EFS might be lost or damaged. The key is based on the user password. On a domain, you can configure recovery agents with the ability to restore the encryption keys.\ntag: C2 L10 TE

GUIDELINES FOR IMPLEMENTING DISASTER RECOVERY AND PREVENTION METHODS\n\nHere are some guidelines to follow to help you implement disaster recovery and prevention.\n\nIMPLEMENT DISASTER RECOVERY AND PREVENTION METHODS\nConsider these guidelines when implementing disaster recovery and prevention methods.\n\n• A disaster recovery plan should:\no Identify scenarios for natural and man-made disasters and options for protecting systems.\no Identify tasks, resources, and responsibilities for responding to a disaster.\no Train staff in the disaster planning procedures and how to react well to change.\n\n• Perform backups of data and configuration files on a regular basis. This might be at the file level or the image level. Critical applications should also be backed up.\n\n• Determine the frequency of backups. This might be hourly, daily, weekly, monthly, or some other interval appropriate for the data and information in your organization.\n\n• Determine data retention needs in both the short and the long term.\n\n• Determine whether you need to perform full, incremental, or differential backups.\n\n• Create a custom recovery image for use in restoring a computer.\n\n• Be aware that when you restore data from a backup, the data is only as current as the backup from which you are restoring, so some data might need to be recreated.\n\n• Test backups after they are created.\n\n• Determine where backups will be stored both locally and offsite.\n\n• Document the account recovery methods that will be needed for any systems, applications, or websites used by the organization.\ntag: C2 L10 TE

Topic F\nBasic Scripting Concepts\n\nEXAM OBJECTIVES COVERED\n1002-4.8 Identify the basics of scripting\n\nMany IT support tasks are quite straightforward but repetitive, Whenever people are called upon to perform repetitive tasks, there is quite a high chance that they will make mistakes. Developing scripts to automate these repetitive tasks means that they can be performed with greater consistency. Also, if you want to change something about the configuration, it is easier to tweak the script than to adjust a large number of desktops or user accounts manually. As a CompTIA A+ technician, you are highly likely to work in environments that make use of scripting. You should understand the basics of how a script is written and executed.\ntag: C2 L10 TF

SCRIPT FILES\n\nA script file is a text document containing commands. The commands might be operating system commands that are run in the order they are listed in the script file. In other cases, the script file lists instructions from a particular scripting language that are interpreted by a command interpreter designed for that particular scripting language. When you access a script file, if the appropriate interpreter is installed on the computer, the instructions contained in the file are run or executed. You can also open the script file in any text editor, such as Windows Notepad.\n\nNote: You can modify any script in a basic text editor such as Notepad, but using a text editor with script support is more productive. Script support means the editor can parse the syntax of the script and highlight elements of it appropriately. For complex scripts, you inight use an Integrated Development Environment (IDE). This will provide autocomplete features to help you write and edit code and debugging tools to help identify if the script is executing correctly.\n\nSCRIPTING LANGUAGES\nIn computer programming, there are several types of instruction sets.\n\n• One is a compiled program, in which the instructions are performed by the computer processor. Examples of compiled language programs are Perl, Java™, C, and C++®.\n\n• The second type is a script, in which the instructions are interpreted and carried out by another program such as the operating system or a command interpreter.\no Examples of script languages include Visual Basic®, Python®, and JavaScript® scripts. These are general purpose scripting languages.\no Batch files and PowerShell® in Windows® operating systems and shell scripts in the Linux® operating system are also considered script files. These languages support the automation and configuration of a particular operating system.\n\n• Most languages can call (or "wrap") system commands as part of the code and can therefore also be used for scripting.\n\nFile extensions for each of these scripting languages are shown in the following table.\n\n| Scripting Language | File Extension |\n| --- | --- |\n| Windows batch file | .bat |\n| PowerShell | .pst |\n| Linux shell script | .sh |\n| VBscript | .vbs |\n| JavaScript | .js |\n| Python | .py |\n\nWhatever language is used to create it, a script is usually a smaller piece of code than a program. A scriptis generally targeted at completing a specific task, whether that task is based within a web-based application or is used by a network administrator to perform a repetitive administrative task. Although a program usually provides some sort of unique functionality, anything a script does could usually be performed manually by a user.\n\nWriting scripts is a good place to learn the basics about programming. They are usually simpler to learn, require no compiling, and are well documented on the Internet should you require guidance or samples.\n\nBATCH FILES\nBatch files are a collection of command-line instructions that you store in a .BAT file. You can run the file by calling its name from the command-line, or double-clicking the file in File Explorer. Generally, batch file scripts run from end to end, and are limited in terms of branching and user input.\n\n[file:///fig-550.png]\nAn example of a Windows batch file. (Screenshot used with permission from Microsoft)\n\nWINDOWS POWERSHELL\nWindows PowerShell enables you to perform management and administrative tasks in Windows 7 and later. It Is fully integrated with the operating system and supports both remote execution and scripting. To help create and manage your Windows PowerShell scripts, Microsoft provides the Windows PowerShell Integrated Scripting Environment (SE).\n \n[file:///fig-551a.png]\nWindows PowerShell ISE. (Screenshot used with permission from Microsoft)\n\nLINUX SHELL SCRIPT\nIn Linux, a shell script is the equivalent of a Windows batch file. A shell script is a file that contains a list of commands to be read and executed by the shell. Frequently used. commands can be stored in a shell script for repeated use. Every shell script starts with aline that designates the interpreter. This line instructs the operating system to execute the script. Shell scripts allow you to perform various functions. These functions include automation of commands and tasks of system administration and troubleshooting, creation of simple applications, and manipulation of text or files.\n\n[file:///fig-551b.png]\nAn example of a Linux shell script open in a text editor.\n\nVBScript\nVeScript is a scripting language based on Microsoft's Visual Basic programming language. VBScript is often used by network administrators to perform repetitive administrative tasks. With VBScript, you can run your scripts from either the command- line or from the Windows graphical interface. Scripts that you write must be run within a host environment. Windows 10 provides Internet Explorer, IIS, and Windows Script Host (WSH) for this purpose.\n \n[file:///fig-552a.png]\nVisual Basic Script in Windows 10, (Screenshot used with permission from Microsoft)\n\nNote: You would now normally use PowerShell for Windows automation tasks. You might need to support legacy VBScripts, though.\n\nJavaScript\nJavaScript is a scripting language that is designed to create interactive web-based content and web apps. The scripts are executed automatically by placing the script in the HTML code for a web page, so that when the HTML code for the page loads, the script is run.\n\n[file:///fig-552b.png]\nAn example of JavaScript code.\n\nPYTHON\nPython is a general-purpose programming language that can be used to develop many different kinds of applications. It is designed to be easy to read and program using much fewer lines of code when compared to other programming languages. The code runs in an interpreter. In Windows, a default interpreter called CPython is installed with the Python development tools supplied by the Python Software Foundation (python.org). Python is preinstalled on many Linux distributions.\n \n[file:///fig-553.png]\nAn example of Python code.\ntag: C2 L10 TF

BASIC SCRIPT CONSTRUCTS\n\nIn order to write a script in a particular language, you must first understand the structure and syntax of the language. Most scripting languages share similarities in their structure and syntax, but it is important to use the specific syntax correctly as any errors will cause the code to not run.\n\nCOMMENT SYNTAX\n\nIt Is important to use comments in code to assist with maintaining it. A comment line is ignored by the compiler or interpreter. A comment line is indicated by a special delimiter, such as double forward slash (/), hash (#), or apostrophe (). The following table identifies the syntax used to add comments to various languages.\n\n| Scripting Language | Comment Syntax |\n| --- | --- |\n| Windows batch file | Rem Comment text is added here\n| | or |\n| | :: Comment text is added here |\n| PowerShell script | # Comment text is added here |\n| Bash shell script | # Comment text is added here |\n| VBscript | // Comment text is added here |\n| JavaScript | // Comment text is added here |\n| Python | # Comment text is added here |\ntag: C2 L10 TF

IDENTIFIERS\n\nAn identifier is used in a program to access a program element, such as a stored value. For example, you might assign the identifier FirstName to a stored value that contains a user's first name. In essence, an identifier is a label for something within your program. If your identifier stores data, then it will be either a variable or a constant.\n\n| Type | Description |\n| --- | --- |\n| Variable | A variable contains a value that can change during the execution of the program. This value might be a text string, a number, or any other data type. |\n| | Variables are usually declared, defined as a particular data type, and given an initial value at the start of the routine in which they are used. It is often possible to use undeclared variables, but this can make code harder to read and more prone to errors. |\n| | Using the example of a first name, it’s important to understand that although a person’s name might not change, if you use a programmatic technique to reference a user’s name without knowing which user you're referring to, then, as far as the program is concerned, that is a variable. You can assign a value to a variable using fairly simple code. For example, the following pseudocode declares the FirstName variable to store a string value with an initial value Andy, then sets it to a value from a data store: |\n| | declare FirstName as String = "Andy" |\n| | FirstName = find LastLoggedOnUser and get Forename | \n| |  print FirstName |\n| | Running this code might produce the following output: |\n| | James |\n| Constants | A constant is a specific identifier that contains a value that cannot be changed within the program. For example, you might want to reference the numerical value for the screen dimensions or resolution. |\ntag: C2 L10 TF

ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES\n\nAn environment variable is a storage location in the environment of the operating system's command shell. For example, when you are entering directory paths as arguments in a script automating some task in Windows, you may not know exactly which locations were chosen for installation. The shell recognizes some system variables and replaces the correct path when one of these is used. Some of the common variables include:\n\n• %SystemDrive%—for example, "C:"\n\n• %SystemRoot%—for example, "C:\Windows"\n\n• %UserName%—for example, "George"\n\n• %HomeDrive%—for example, "C:"\n\n• %HomePath%—for example, "\Users\George"\n\nIn Windows, you can view the full list of variables by using the set command (without switches) at the command prompt. set also lets you create and modify new variables. You can also view variables through the Advanced page of the System Properties dialog box by selecting the Environment Variables button.\n\nIn Linux, you use the printenv or env commands to view and change environment variables. However, in Linux, each shell can use additional variables, configured by using the set command.\n\nNote: if you need to use environment variables outside of a batch file or shell script, each language will have a different syntax for reading them.\ntag: C2 L10 TF

BRANCHES AND LOOPS\n\nA script contains one or more statements. In the normal scheme of execution, each statement is processed in turn from top to bottom. Scripts are used for tasks that are too complex to be completed as a simple series of statements, though. In this case, you can change the order in which statements are executed based on logical conditions evaluated within the script. There are two main types of conditional execution: branches and loops.\n\nBRANCHES\nA script runs from the start to the end unless you instruct it to deviate from this path. One way of doing so is to create a branch, which is an instruction to your computer to execute a different sequence of instructions. You use branches to control the flow within your program.\n\nFor example, you might create a branch based on a condition; you might verify that a number has been entered correctly. If it has, then one thing happens, and if it has not, then something else happens. This is a conditional branch.\n\nFor example, in the following pseudocode, the value of a variable called DisplayNumber is compared to 25. If DisplayNumber is greater than 25, then a variable called Count is incremented by 1. If DisplayNumber is less than 25, no action occurs and the variable Count remains the same.\n\nIf DisplayNumber > 25 Then\nCount = Count+1\nEnd If\n\nLoops\nLoops are similar to branches in as much as they deviate from a linear sequence of statements according to some sort of logic condition. However, with a loop, you instruct your computer to perform, or repeat, a task until a condition is met. For example, you might create a loop that continues until a certain amount of time has elapsed or until a counter reaches a certain level. Then, a predetermined action might occur, depending upon what you want. In the following example, the program loops around until the value of i is 5. Then the program proceeds to the next statement.\n\nFor i = 1 to 5\nprint i\nNext\n\nAs well as "For" structures, loops can also be implemented by "While" statements:\n\nDo While i <= 100\ni = i + 1\nprint i\nLoop\n\nNote: Make sure your code does not contain unintended or infinite loops. Without the statement to increment i in the Do loop example, the loop would continue forever. An infinite loop will make the process hang.\ntag: C2 L10 TF

OPERATORS\n\nLooping and branching structures depend on logical tests to determine whether to\ncontinue the loop or the branch to follow. A logical test is one that resolves to a TRUE\nor FALSE value. You need to be familiar with basic comparison operators:\n\n•  == is equal to (returns TRUE if both conditions are the same).\n\n• != is not equal to.\n\n• < less than.\n\n• > greater than.\n\n• <= and >= less than or equal to and greater than or equal to.\n\nYou might also want to test more than one condition at the same time. The logical operators are as follows:\n\n• AND—if both conditions are TRUE, then the whole statement is TRUE.\n\n• OR-if either condition is TRUE, then the whole statement is TRUE.\n\n• XOR-if either condition is TRUE but not both, then the whole statement is TRUE.\n\nYou can also use the negation operator NOT to reverse the truth value of any statement.\ntag: C2 L10 TF

BASIC DATA TYPES\n\nIt Is important to understand the different data types that a script can use. The CPU and storage devices in a computer only process data as ones and zeros. These hardware components have no conception of what the data mean. When it comes to writing scripts, though, data types are very important because they determine what sort of operations can be performed. For example, the characters "51" can be treated as a number value, in which case you can use the data in addition and subtraction, or they can be treated as a text string (representing a house number, for instance). If "51" is stored as a string, it must be converted before it can be used in a mathematical operation.\n\nThere are different types of number values and a variety of text forms. These include:\n\n| Data Type | Description |\n| --- | --- |\n| Integers | These are whole numbers. For example: 5, 21, or 65536. An integer data type consumes 1 to 8 bytes of computer storage. |\n| Floating point numbers | This type can support decimal fractions such as 4.1, 26.4, or 5.62. A floating point number (or just "float") consumes between 4 and 8 bytes of storage. Note that the floating point type could store a whole number too (4.0, for instance). |\n| Boolean values | These are a special numeric data type indicating that something is either TRUE or FALSE (with a 1 or 0). They consume a single bit of storage. |\n| Characters | A character (or char) is a single textual character, and can be a letter of the alphabet, a symbol, or, indeed, a numerical character. For example: a, D, 7, $,@, #. These consume one byte of storage. Note that when a number is entered as a character data type, you cannot perform any mathematical operations on it. |\n| strings | A string is a collection of text characters. For example: XYZ, Hello world. There is no real limit on the amount of storage that can be used by a string, Generally, you define the string length when you define the data type. |\n\nWhen single or double quotes can be used to delimit a string ("Hello World"), the quotes are NOT part of the string itself. If you want to represent a quote character (or other delimiter) within a string, you have to use an escape character. For example, the string "John said \'Hello World\' then left again." contains two single quotes, escaped using the backslash character (\).\n\nNote: Different languages have different escape characters, but the backslash is often the syntax used.\n\n| Scripting Language | Escape Character |\n| --- | --- |\n| Windows batch file | %% |\n| Powershell | There are different escape characters for different circumstances. |\n| | --% |\n| | ` |\n| | \ |\n| Linux Bash shell script | \ |\n| VBscript | To escape a single quote, enter two single quotes: '' |\n| | To escape a double quote, enter two double quotes: "" |\n| | Use the Escape (charString) function to encode a string so that the string contains only ASCII characters. Any other characters are replaced with %##, where ## is the hexadecimal equivalent to the character.\n| JavaScript | \ |\n| Python | \ |\ntag: C2 L10 TF

CUSTOMER SERVICE ATTITUDE\n\nA service technician should not only understand technical issues but must also be a good communicator. It is easy to pick up facts and information but it can be much harder to use this information in a troubleshooting scenario requiring customer interaction, whether face-to-face or over the telephone.\n\nLearning how to deal with customers, interpret the information they give you, and respond to their queries can be difficult but logical problem diagnosis and successful techniques for working with customers go hand-in-hand. A person with poor customer contact ability is not likely to impress as a professional customer service technician, even if he or she is competent at technical problem solving.\n\nRemember that "customer" need not refer to someone who buys something; it can include any users or clients of a support service.\n\nThree golden rules can be applied to good customer service:\n\n• Be positive—project confidence, be in control, and drive the issue towards resolution.\n\n• Be clear, concise, and direct.\n\n• Be consistent, fair, and respectful.\ntag: C2 L10 TG

COMMUNICATION SKILLS\n\nThere are many things that contribute to the art of communication: the words you use, listening effectively, and giving feedback are particularly important.\n\nUSING PROPER LANGUAGE\nWhen you greet someone, you should be conscious of making a good first impression. When you arrive onsite, make eye contact, introduce yourself and your company, and shake hands. When you answer the phone, introduce yourself and your department and offer assistance.\n\nWhen you speak to a customer, you need to make sense. Obviously, you must be factually accurate, but it is equally important that the customer understands what you are saying. Not only does this show the customer that you are competent, but it also proves that you are in control of the situation and gives the customer confidence in your abilities. You need to use clear and concise statements that avoid jargon, abbreviations, acronyms, and other technical language that a user might not understand. For example, compare the following scenarios:\n\n| Scenario 1 | Scenario 2 |\n| --- | --- |\n| "Looking at the TFT, can you tell me whether the driver is signed?" | "Is a green check mark displayed on the icon?" |\n\nThe first question depends on the user understanding what a TFT is, what a signed driver might be, and knowing that a green check mark indicates one. The second question gives you the same information without having to rely on the user's understanding.\n\nWhile you do not have to speak very formally, avoid being over-familiar with customers. Try not to use very informal language (slang) and do not use any language that may cause any sort of offense. For example, you should greet a customer by saying "Hello" or "Good morning," rather than "Whassup?" or "Hey!"\n\nLISTENING AND QUESTIONING\nYou must listen carefully to what is being said to you; it will give you clues to the customer's technical level, enabling you to pace and adapt your replies accordingly. Active listening is the skill of listening to an individual so that you give them your full attention and are not trying to argue with, comment on, or misinterpret what they have said.\n\nWith active listening, you make a conscious effort to keep your attention focused on what the other person is saying, as opposed to being distracted by thinking what your reply is going to be or by some background noise or interruption. Some of the other techniques of active listening are to reflect phrases used by the other person or to restate the issue and summarize what they have said. This helps to reassure the other person that you have attended to what they have to say. You should also try to take notes of what the customer says so that you have an accurate record.\n\n[file:///fig-566.png]\nListening carefully will help you to get the most information from what a customer tells you. (Image by goodluz © 123RF.com.)\n\nIt is important to understand that you must not interrupt customers when they are speaking. Also, do not ignore what they have said. If you are rude in this sort of way, the customer will form a poor opinion of you and may become less willing to help with troubleshooting.\n\nThere will inevitably be a need to establish some technical facts with the customer. This means questioning (or probing) the customer for information. There are two broad types of questioning:\n\n• Open—a question that invites the other person to compose a response, such as What seems to be the problem?\n\n• Closed—a question that can only be answered with a "Yes" or "No" or that requires some other fixed response ("What error number is displayed on the panel?" for instance).\n\nThe basic technique is start with open questions. You may try to guide the customer towards what information will be most helpful. For example, "When you say your printer is not working, what problem are you having—will it not switch on?" However, be careful about assuming what the problem is and leading the customer to simply affirming a guess. As the customer explains what they know, you may be able to perceive what the problem is. if so, do not assume anything too early. Ask pertinent closed questions that prove or disprove your perception. The customer may give you information that is vague or ambiguous. Clarify what they mean by asking questions like "What did the error message say?," or "When you say the printout is dark, is there a faint image or is it completely black?," or "Is the power LED on the printer lit?" If a customer is not getting to the point or if you want to follow some specific steps, take charge of the conversation at the earliest opportunity by asking closed questions. For example, compare the following scenario:\n\n| Scenario 1 | Scenario 2 |\n| --- | --- |\n| "It's been like this for ages now, and I've tried pressing a key and moving the mouse, but nothing happens." | "It's been like this for ages now, and I've tried pressing a key and moving the mouse, but nothing happens." |\n| "What does the screen look like?" | "Ok, pressing a key should work normally, but as it isn't I'd like to investigate something else first. Can you tell me whether the light on the monitor is green?" |\n| "It's dark. I thought the computer was just resting and I know in that circumstance I need to press a key, but that’s not working and I really need to get on with..." |\n| | "No, there's a yellow light though." |\n\nIn the first example, the technician asks an open question, which just lets the user focus on what they perceive as the problem, but which isn’t producing any valuable troubleshooting information. Using a closed question, as in the second example, allows the technician to start working through a series of symptoms to try to diagnose the problem.\n\nDo note that a long sequence of closed questions fired off rapidly may overwhelm and confuse a customer. Do not try to force the pace. Establish the customer's technical level and target the conversation accordingly. A customer with little technical knowledge will be confused by technical information; conversely, a knowledgeable customer may know exactly what the problem is and will not appreciate being treated like a novice. On the other hand, don’t assume that the customer has diagnosed the problem correctly. Sometimes a little knowledge is worse than no knowledge at all.\n\nGIVING FEEDBACK\nWhen you give the customer instructions—for example, if you want them to try to complete a series of troubleshooting steps—be clear and concise. This is where having a good "mental map" of the sequence of steps to any particular configuration option demonstrates its value. Always confirm that the customer has taken the correct step. \n\nAlso, you must be patient; remember that the customer probably has little idea of what they are doing and will proceed quite slowly.\n\nFiring question after question at a customer can be off-putting, especially if the customer does not understand what he or she is being asked to do or check.\n\nTechnical support depends on good customer relationships. A good understanding between you and a customer also makes troubleshooting that much easier. This sort of understanding is often referred to as rapport.\n\nReact to what you learn about the customer's technical ability, and develop the conversation in a positive manner to help resolve the issue. Try and form a partnership with the customer. Avoid using the pronoun "you," as it can imply blame and push the customer away from you. Consider the following:\n \n| Scenario 1 | Scenario 2 |\n| --- | --- |\n| "Have you checked that the printeris turned on?" | "Let's make sure the printer’s turned on." |\n\nThe first statement implies blame and signals that you are not prepared to accept responsibility for troubleshooting the problem. The second emphasizes you are willing to share responsibility for solving the problem and provide assistance at every step.\ntag: C2 L10 TG

PROFESSIONALISM\n\nProfessionalism means taking pride in one’s work and in treating people fairly. Several techniques and procedures can be used to develop an effective support service. You should understand these and the personal qualities that you should develop.\n\nPROPER DOCUMENTATION\nOne of the key points of providing an effective support service is making it easy for customers to contact it. Most support takes place either over the telephone or through an email/web contact form. More advanced options include text messaging and Remote Assistance-style desktop sharing.\n\nWhatever the method used, the contact information and hours of operation should be well advertised, so that the customer knows what to do. The service should have proper documentation, so that the customer knows what to expect in terms of items that are supported, how long incidents may take to resolve, when they can expect an item to be replaced instead of repaired, and so on.\n\nPROBLEM MANAGEMENT\nProblem management means tracking and auditing support requests. Whatever the tools and resources used to implement problem management, the basic process of receiving a support request, resolving the problem, and verifying the solution remains much the same.\n\nOn receiving the request (whether it is a call, email, or face-to-face contact), acknowledge the request and set expectations. For example, repeat the request back to the customer, then state the next steps, such as "I have assigned this problem to David Martin. If you don't hear from us by 3pm, please call me." The customer may have a complaint, a problem with some equipment, or simply a request for information. It is important to clarify the nature of these factors:\n\n• The customer's expectations of what will be done and when to fix the problem.\n\n• The customer's concerns about cost or the impact on business processes.\n\n• Your constraints—time, parts, costs, contractual obligations, and so on.\n\nIt is important not to allow the customer to form unrealistic expectations of how long the problem will take to solve. On the other hand, you should focus your attenti resolving the customer's concerns (if they are valid). Consider this exchange for example:\n\n| Customer | A+ Technician |\n| --- | --- |\n| "I have to get a job application printed today—you must send a technician around immediately." | "Do you have another print device that you could use?" |\n| "No, l only have one printer and it's not working." | "Do you have email? You should be able to send the job application to a copy shop and they'll print it for you for a small fee." |\n| "Yes, but I'm sure I don’t know about any stores like that." | "There's actually a location a short distance from your house. If you have a pen and paper ready, I can give you the details and arrange an appointment for a technician to come and inspect your printer..." |\n\nThe course of action that you agree on must be realistic and achievable.\n\n[file:///fig-569.png]\nAcknowledge the request and set expectations. (Image by goodluz © 123RF.com,)\n\nEach request must be logged as an incident or ticket so that progress on resolving it can be documented, Most support departments use a Call Management or Problem. Management System for this.\n\nAs with any communications, job tickets should be completed professionally, with due regard for spelling, grammar, and clarity. Remember that other people may need to take action using just the information in the ticket and that analysis of tickets will take place as part of quality assurance procedures. It is also possible that tickets will be forwarded to customers as a record of the jobs performed.\n\nIf possible, the request should be resolved in one call. If this is not possible, the call should be dealt with as quickly as possible, and escalated to a senior support team if a solution cannot be found promptly. What is important is that you drive problem acceptance and resolution, either by working on a solution yourself or ensuring that the problem is accepted by the assigned person or department.\n\n[file:///fig-570.png]\nCreatinga ticket in the Spiceworks IT Support management tool. (Screenshot courtesy of spiceworks.com.)\n\nIf a problem cannot be resolved within the course of a single call, it is imperative to manage the customer's expectations of when the problem will be resolved. Customers should not feel the need to call you to find out what's happening. This is irritating for them to do and means time is wasted dealing with an unnecessary call.\n\nIf have resolved the problem, and tested that the system is operating normally again, you should give the customer a general indication of what caused the problem and what you did to fix it plus assurance that the problem is now fixed and unlikely to reoccur. On leaving or on ending the call, thank the customer for their time and assistance and show that you have appreciated the chance to help them.\n\nWhen the solution has been tested and verified and the customer has expressed satisfaction with the resolution of the problem, log the problem as closed. Record the solution and send verification to the customer via email or phone call.\n\nPRIORITIZING WORK\nTime is an invaluable factor in the service industry because workload usually outweighs staff resources. Time management practices impact the level of service you are able to provide to your customers.\n\nAnybody who requests support will hope that their problem can be resolved immediately. However, this is not always possible for a number of reasons, and the customer's idea of an acceptable response time may vary greatly from your own. A formal call management system will usually allow a priority code to be assigned to a call. Open tickets can be monitored and re-prioritized to ensure that they do not fail to meet the agreed on service and performance levels.\n\nPUNCTUALITY AND ACCOUNTABILITY\nIf a customer expects a visit—or call or email—from a service technician at a certain time, it is reasonable to assume that the technician will respond as promised. If it becomes obvious that the technician is not going to be on time, then the customer should be informed as soon as possible. A customer may make special arrangements to be with the technician at the allotted time and changes can be very annoying.\n\nBe accountable for your actions, both before you arrive on site and while on site. This usually means being honest and direct about issues, but make sure this is done in a positive manner. For example:\n\n• "I'm sorry I'm late—show me this faulty PC and I'l start work right away."\n\n• "The printer needs a new fuser—and I'm afraid that I don’t have this type with me. What I will do is call the office and find out how quickly we can get one..."\n\n• "I've not seen this problem before, but I have taken some notes and I'll check this out as soon as I get back to the office. I'll give you a call this afternoon—will that be OK?"\n\nFLEXIBILITY AND COMPROMISE\nAs a service technician, you want to ensure your customer receives the best possible attention at all times but, unfortunately, saying no is sometimes inevitable:\n\n• The customer may ask that you do something beyond your control or perhaps beyond the terms of the service contract.\n\n• The customer may ask you to confirm a fact or detail beyond your control.\n\n• The customer may demand a replacement when a repair option is the only one merited by your company’s procedures.\n\nConsider the following examples; which approach is better?\n\n| Customer | A+ Technician |\n| --- | --- |\n| "My printer is broken again—I want a replacement." | 1. "I'm sorry, we can't do that... |\n| | 2. "I can arrange for a technician to be with you first thing tomorrow, and I'll mention to my supervisor that this is the second time this has occurred." |\n| "Can you guarantee that the technician will be with me before 3 pm?" | 1. "Sorry, I can't guarantee a specific  time." |\n| | 2. "I'll ask the technician to try and visit before 3 pm if possible, and I'll call you around 2 pm if it looks like the technician will be later than that—is this OK?" |\n\nNote: The key to saying *no* in a positive way is to offer an alternative.\ntag: C2 L10 TG

RESPECT\n\nRespect means that you treat others (and their property) as you would like to be treated, Respect is one of the hallmarks of professionalism. At a bare minimum, respect means not being rude or offensive. Some of the other elements are listed below.\n\n• Avoid Distractions. Do not allow interruptions when you are working at a customer's site. Do not take calls from colleagues unless they are work related, urgent, and important. Do not take personal calls or respond to texts or posts on social media.\n\nIf you are speaking with a customer on the telephone, always ask their permission before putting them on hold or transferring their call.\n\n• Respect for Property and Confidentiality.\no Do not treat customers’ property carelessly. Do not use equipment or services such as PCs, printers, web access, or phones without permission and never for personal use.\no If you are visiting someone's home or office do not help yourself to food or drink, ask before using the bathroom, and do not attempt to snoop around other areas. Do not be tempted to snoop around data files on someone else's PC either!\no If you find printed copies of confidential materials while performing some support task (bank statements or personal letters for instance), do not look at them, make the customer aware of them, and allow time for them to be put away.\no If you are making a site visit, keep the area in which you are working clean and tidy and leave it as you found it.\n\n• Cultural Sensitivity.\no Cultural sensitivity means being aware of customs and habits used by other people. Its easy to associate culture simply with national elements, such as the difference between the way Americans and Japanese greet one another. Within each nation, there are many different cultures, however, created by things such a social class, business opportunities, leisure pursuits, and so on. For example, a person may expect to be addressed using a professional title, such as a doctor or a judge; other people may be more comfortable speaking on a first name basis. It is safer to start on a formal basis and use more informal language if the customer signals that they are happier speaking that way.\no You need to realize that though a person may be influenced by several cultures, their behavior is not determined by culture. Customer service and support requires consideration for other people. You cannot show this if you make assumptions about their cultural background without treating them as an individual (stereotyping).\no Accent, dialect, and language are some of the crucial elements of cultural sensitivity. These can make it hard for you to understand a customer and perhaps difficult for a customer to understand you. When dealing with a language barrier, use questions, summaries, and restatements to clarify customer statements. Consider using visual aids or demonstrations rather than trying to explain something in words.\no Also, different cultures define personal space differently, so be aware of how close or far you are from the customer.\ntag: C2 L10 TG

CUSTOMER COMPLAINTS\n\nAll customer complaints, whether they are valid or not, should be treated with equal seriousness.\n\nMAINTAIN A POSITIVE ATTITUDE\nUnderstand that an angry customer is usually frustrated that things are not working properly or feels let down (perhaps the technician arrived late). Empathizing with the customer is a good way of developing a positive relationship towards resolving their problem. Saying you are sorry does not necessarily mean you agree with what the customer is saying, just that you can understand their point of view.\n\n"I'm sorry you're having a problem with your new PC. Let's see what we can do to sort things out..."\n\nArguing with the customer, denying that a problem exists, or being judgmental (assuming that the problem is of the customer's making because they do not understand the system properly) will only tend to lower the customer's impression of the service you offer. Do not try to dismiss a problem out of hand or minimize its importance. If the customer has taken it to the point of complaining, then clearly they feel that it is important; whether you consider the matter trivial is not the issue.\n\nListen while the customer explains the problem and let them know that you are listening. On the phone, use confirmatory phrases such as "Yes," "I see," and "Uh-huh" from time to time to make sure the customer knows you are paying attention. Do not just repeat the same phrase every few seconds—the customer may think you are mocking them.\n\nIf you are face-to-face with the customer, maintain eye contact and nod your head frequently but watch your body language. Do not fold your arms as this puts up a barrier.\n\nBE ACCURATE AND HONEST\nA common problem when dealing with customer complaints is feeling that you have to defend every action of your company or department. If the customer makes a true statement about your levels of service (or that of other employees), do not try and think of a clever excuse or mitigating circumstance for the failing; you will sound as though you do not care.\n\nIf you have let a customer down, it is probably best to empathize while including some positive actions:\n\n"You're right—I'm sorry the technician didn't turn up. | guarantee that a technician will be with you by 3pm and I'l let my supervisor know that you have had to call us. Shall I call you back just after 3 to make sure that things are OK?"\n\nOn the other hand, if the customer is incorrect in their understanding of the situation, empathy and correction is in order:\n\n"I'm sorry the replacement disk hasn't arrived, but I know it was put in the mail. Would you be happy to wait to see whether it arrives tomorrow or should I mail another one to you?"\n\nIf the customer had a valid cause to complain about levels of service or any aspect of your company's operation, resolve the problem and then investigate what can be done to ensure this type of problem never occurs again.\n\nDEALING WITH A DIFFICULT CUSTOMER\nIt is never easy to talk to someone who is being unreasonable, abusive, or shouting down the telephone but it is important to be able to deal with these situations professionally.\n\n1. Identify signs that a customer is becoming angry early (for example, raised voice, speaking too quickly, interrupting, and so on). Try to calm the situation down by using a low voice, soothing language, and focusing on positive actions.\n\n2. Do not take complaints personally—provided that you haven't deliberately caused the problem about which the customer is complaining, they are using you as a representative of your organization and any anger expressed in your direction is not personal but a symptom of their frustration.\n\n3. Listen and let the customer explain the problem—draw out the facts and use them as a positive action plan to drive the conversation forward.\n\n4. Hang up—if a customer is persistently abusive or threatening, issue a caution, then warn them about their behavior, then end the call or contact if they do not act reasonably.\n\n[file:///fig-574.png]\nLet the customer vent. (Image by Wang Tom © 123RF.com)\n\nBE PROFESSIONAL\nEveryone has bad days when they feel the need to get some difficult situation off their chest. Perhaps a customer has been particularly obtuse or foolish or perhaps someone has treated you unpleasantly. Find a colleague for a private face-to-face chat but under no circumstances should you ever disclose these types of experiences via social media outlets. Remember that anything posted to social media is very hard to withdraw and can cause unpredictable reactions. Tweeting some mistake made by someone you have supported is a sure way to get yourself and your company in trouble.\ntag: C2 L10 TG
