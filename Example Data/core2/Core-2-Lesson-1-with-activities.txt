Lesson 1\nSupporting Operating Systems\n\nLESSON INTRODUCTION\nAs a professional IT support representative or PC service technician, your job will include installing, configuring, maintaining, and troubleshooting personal computer operating systems, applications, hardware, and networks. Before you can perform any of these tasks, you need to understand the basics of what an operating system is, including the various versions, features, components, and technical capabilities. With this knowledge, you can provide effective support for all types of system environments.\n\nThe operating system is the software that provides a user interface to the computer hardware and provides an environment in which to run software applications and create computer networks. In this lesson, you will identify the basic types, functions, features, and tools of operating systems, with a particular focus on Microsoft® Windows®.\n\nLESSON OBJECTIVES\nIn this lesson, you will:\n• Compare common OSs and their purposes and features.\n• Use administrative tools and system utilities in different versions of Windows.\n• Perform file management using Explorer and command prompt tools.\n• Use the command-line tools and the Disk Management console to configure disks, volumes, arrays, and mount points.\n• Use Device Manager and Control Panel/Settings to configure power management, display and sound devices, and to remove devices.\n\nThe Official CompTIA® A+® Core 2 Student Guide (Exam 220-1002)  |  writing is Windows 10 Spring Creators Update (1803), replacing the Fall Creators\nUpdate (1709).\ntag:C2 L1

Topic A\nIdentify Common Operating Systems\n\nEXAM OBJECTIVES COVERED\n1002-1.1 Compare and contrast common operating system types and their purposes.\n1002-1.2 Compare and contrast features of Microsoft Windows versions.\n\nIn this topic, you will identify the types and functions of personal computer (PC) and mobile device operating systems. The first step is to learn about the various operating systems available today, and to identify those that are commonly used on PCs and those that are used on tablets and smartphones.\n\nWithout a user-friendly operating system, most people would not be capable of using their computers or mobile devices to successfully perform the tasks required of them. As an IT professional, being familiar with the different types of operating systems can help you to support a variety of computer and mobile device environments.\ntag:C2 L1 TA
 
WHAT IS AN OPERATING SYSTEM?\n\nA computer requires an operating system (OS) in order to function. The operating system provides the interface between the hardware, application programs, and the user. The operating system handles many of the basic system functions, such as interaction with the system hardware and input/output.\n\nAn operating system is generally made up of a number of core files—called the kernel—with additional device drivers and programs to provide extended functionality. The earliest operating systems for PCs, such as Microsoft's Disk Operating System (DS), used a command-line user interface or simple menu systems. Windows and software applications for Windows were marked by the use of a Graphical User Interface (GUI). This helped to make computers easier to use by non-technical staff and home users.\n\nNote: Actually, some DOS applications presented a GUI, of a kind. Windows is sometimes described as a WIMP (Window, Icon, Menu, Pointing device) interface.\n\nThe desktop style favored by a particular OS or OS version is a powerful factor in determining customer preferences for one OS over another.\n\nOS TYPES\nThe market for operating systems is divided into four main sections:\n+ Business client—an 0S designed to work as a client in business networks.\n+ Network Operating System (NOS)—an OS designed to run on servers in business networks.\n+ Home client—an OS designed to work on standalone or workgroup PCs in a home or small office,\n+ Cell phone (smartphone/Tablet—an OS designed to work with a handheld portable device. This type of OS must have a touch-operated interface.\ntag:C2 L1 TA

COMPATIBILITY ISSUES\n\nA software application is coded to run on a particular OS. You cannot install an app written for i0S® on an Android™ smartphone. The developer must create a different version of the app. This can be relatively easy for the developer or quite difficult, depending on the way the app is coded and the target platforms. The application or app “ecosystem,” or the range of software available for a particular OS, is another big driver of customer acceptance for a particular OS product.\n\nCompatibility also affects version updates to operating system software. There is always a chance that some change in the new OS version will cause software (or hardware device drivers) written for an older version not to work properly. In the business client market, this makes companies very reluctant to update to new OS versions without extensive testing. As extensive testing is very expensive, they are generally reluctant to adopt new versions without a compelling need to do so.\n\nNote: These compatibility concerns are being mitigated somewhat by the use of web applications and cloud services. A web application only needs the browser to be compatible, not the whole OS. The main compatibility issue for a web application is supporting a touch interface and a very wide range of display resolutions on the different devices that might connect to it.\n\nFinally, compatibility also affects the way that computers running different operating systems can communicate on data networks. The computers cannot “talk” to one another directly. The operating systems must support common network protocols that allow data to be exchanged in a standard format.\ntag:C2 L1 TA

MICROSOFT WINDOWS\n\nMicrosoft Windows is the dominant commercial PC OS, estimated to be installed on ‘90% of the world's desktop and laptop computers. The Windows Server OS is also widely used on private network servers and Internet servers running web, email, and social networking apps.\n\nLike most software, Windows and Windows Server® have been released in a number of versions over the years. Historically, a new version would have to be purchased, though upgrade discounts were usually available. A new version may introduce significant changes in desktop styles and user interface of Windows and add new features and support for new types of hardware. On the downside, a new version may not be compatible with hardware and software applications designed for earlier versions.\n\nOne of the main functions of an OS is to provide an interface (or shell) between the user and the computer hardware and software. Windows has a number of interface components designed both for general use and for more technical configuration and troubleshooting.\n\nThe top level of the user interface is the desktop. This is displayed when Windows. starts and the user logs on. The desktop contains icons to launch applications and possibly user data files. The desktop also contains the Start Menu or Start Screen and taskbar, which are used to launch and control applications.\ntag:C2 L1 TA

MICROSOFT WINDOWS VERSIONS\n\nLet's start by taking a look at the most popular versions of Windows currently in use. Other operating systems will be examined more closely later in the course.\ntag:C2 L1 TA

WINDOWS 10\n\nWindows 10, first released in 2015, is the current version. Windows 10 aims to provide a consistent user experience across different types of devices, including desktop PCs, laptops, tablets, and smartphones.\n\nWhen installed to a PC or laptop, Windows 10 retains the user desktop and taskbar familiar from legacy versions but uses a touch-optimized Start Screen interface to access apps and programs. This replaces the old Start Menu. As well as shortcuts, the Start Screen can display app tiles, which can contain live or actively updated content. These app tiles are fully customizable.\n\n(https://4sorcero.s3.amazonaws.com/byteback/core_2/fig_core_2_4.png)\nWindows 10 (1803) desktop and Start Screen. (Screenshot used with permission from Microsoft.)\n\nThe Start Screen is activated by selecting the Start button KE or by pressing the Windows key, which might also be labeled the Start key.\n\nNote: On a smartphone or tablet, the Start Screen replaces the desktop entirely.\ntag:C2 L1 TA

WINDOWS 10 FEATURE UPDATES\n\nWith Windows 10, Microsoft indicated that they would no longer release new versions of Windows, but would instead maintain the OS with feature updates on a periodic basis. Thus, the current version of Windows, at the time of writing, is still Windows 10. This approach is known as “Windows as a service.” Feature updates for Windows 10, are identified with a name and number. For example, in July 2016, Microsoft released a Windows 10 feature update called Windows 10 Anniversary Update. This release was identified with the number 1607, which corresponds to the year (2016) and month (07/ July) of release. The full name of the current version of Windows 10 at the time of writing is Windows 10 Spring Creators Update (1803), replacing the Fall Creators Update (1709).\n\nIn addition to feature updates, Windows is updated periodically with quality updates. Quality updates do not usually make radical changes to Windows, though some do include new features. Quality updates might sometimes cause compatibility problems with some hardware devices and software applications, but this is less likely than with feature updates.\n\nWindows 10 Mobile\nMicrosoft has developed versions of Windows for mobile devices, including Windows CE, Windows Phone® 7, and Windows Phone 8. None of these have enjoyed the same sort of success as Windows has in the PC market.\n\nWith Windows 10 Mobile, Microsoft has adopted a consistent user interface and code base across all types of devices. Windows 10 Mobile has a very small smartphone market share compared to Android and iOS. Microsoft develops and sells Windows 10 Mobile smartphones and Surface® tablets.\ntag:C2 L1 TA

WINDOWS 8 AND WINDOWS 8.1\n\nCompared to earlier versions, Windows 8 (released in 2012) and Windows 8.1 (2013) imposed significant user interface changes to provide better support for touchscreens. One of these changes was the first use of the Start Screen. Not all of the changes were popular with users familiar with Windows 7, however. Windows 10 addressed this feedback and was also made available as a free upgrade to Windows 8. Consequently, Windows 10 very quickly replaced Windows 8 and Windows 8 is not that widely used, having about 7% market share at the time of writing.\n\nAs well as introducing the Start Screen for the first time, in Windows 8, some of the search and configuration settings are accessed as charms. The Charms bar is opened by swiping from the right of the screen.\n\n(https://4sorcero.s3.amazonaws.com/byteback/core_2/fig_core_2_5.png)\nWindows 8.1 showing the Charms bar. (Screenshot used with permission from Microsoft.)\n\nOn a desktop PC, you can move the mouse pointer down from the top-right or (more simply) press Windows+C. The Charms bar was discontinued in Windows 10.\n\nNote: Windows 8 was swiftly updated to Windows 8.1 to address some issues with the interface, principally the lack of a Start button and forcing use of the Start Screen at boot rather than the desktop. In other respects, references to Windows & in this course can be taken to apply to Windows 8.1, too. There was never a Windows 9.\ntag:C2 L1 TA

WINDOWS 7\n\nPrior to Windows 8, there was Windows 7 (2009), Windows Vista (2007), and Windows XP (2001). Of these, Windows 7 is still widely used, with an estimated installation base of around 45% of all PCs. Despite no longer being officially supported by Microsoft, Windows XP is still installed on about 5% of devices. Windows Vista never achieved a significant market share.\n\nWindows 7 uses the "classic" Start Menu user interface. The Start Menu contains icon shortcuts to recently used programs and some of the main folders and utilities. The All Programs submenu contains the shortcuts to all the other desktop applications. installed on the computer.\n\n(https://4sorcero.s3.amazonaws.com/byteback/core_2/fig_core_2_6.png)\nWindows 7 desktop and Start Menu. (Screenshot used with permission from Microsoft.)\n\nNote: According to the CompTIA exam objectives, you will not be expected to support Windows Vista or Windows XP.\ntag:C2 L1 TA

WINDOWS EDITIONS\n\nEach version of Windows is available in different editions. Editions are used by Microsoft to create different markets for Windows. Windows 7 editions included Starter, Home Basic, Home Premium, Professional, Enterprise, and Ultimate. Windows 10 is available in the following editions:\n\n• Windows 10 Home—designed for domestic consumers and Small Office Home Office (SOHO) business use. The Home edition cannot be used to join a Windows domain network.\n\n• Windows 10 Pro—designed for small and medium-sized businesses. The "Professional" edition comes with networking and management features designed to allow network administrators more control over each client device.\n\n* Windows 10 Enterprise/Windows 10 Enterprise (Long Term Servicing Channel) — similar to the Pro edition but designed for volume licensing by medium and large enterprises.\n\n• Windows 10 Education/Pro Education—variants of the Enterprise and Pro editions designed for licensing by schools and colleges.\n\nNote: The Windows 7 Ultimate edition was a "superset" with all the features from other editions. Ultimate editions were discontinued with Windows 8. The distinction between basic and premium home editions was also abandoned. Windows 8 has an unnamed edition—sometimes referred to as "Windows 8 Core"—rather than a "Home" edition.\ntag:C2 L1 TA

WINDOWS IN THE CORPORATE WORLD\n\nThe principal distinguishing feature of the Professional/Pro, Enterprise, Ultimate, and Education editions (regardless of version) is the ability to join a domain network. A personal user or small business owner can just administer each machine they own individually. On a corporate network, it is necessary to manage user accounts and system policies centrally, because there are more machines to manage and security requirements are higher. This centralized management is provided by joining each computer to a domain, where the accounts are configured on Domain Controller (DC) servers. Some other notable corporate features are as follows:\n\n• BitLocker—enables the user to encrypt all the information on a disk drive. Encryption means that data on the device is protected even if someone steals it (as long as they cannot crack the user password). BitLocker is included with Windows 7 Enterprise and Ultimate, Windows 8 Pro and Enterprise, and Windows 10 Pro, Enterprise, and Education editions.\n\n• Encrypting File System (EFS)—where BitLocker encrypts an entire drive, EFS can be used to apply file- or folder-level encryption. EFS is included with Windows 7 Professional, Enterprise, and Ultimate, Windows 8 Pro and Enterprise, and Windows 10 Pro, Enterprise, and Education editions.\n\n• BranchCache—an enterprise might have computers installed at different geographic locations needing to view and update data at a central office. As the Wide Area Network (WAN) links from each location to the office might be quite slow, itcan be useful for the remote computers to share access to a single cache of data from shared folders and files or document portals such as SharePoint sites. This reduces the amount of WAN traffic because each client does not have to download its own copy individually. BranchCache is supported on Windows 7 Enterprise and Ultimate, Windows 8 Enterprise, and Windows 10 Pro, Enterprise, and Education editions.\n\nNote: The Pro/Professional editions support a limited type of BranchCache for Background intelligent Transfer Service (BITS) communications only. Most document and file sharing uses HyperText Transfer Protocol (HTTP) or Server Message Block (SMB), and these types of transfers are only supported by the Enterprise/Ultimate editions. BITS might be used for tasks such as patch deployment or image-based installs.\ntag:C2 L1 TA

WINDOWS FOR PERSONAL USE\n\nWindows Media Center is a Microsoft app allowing the computer to be used as a sort of home entertainment appliance, such as playing DVDs (several other functions of the product are no longer supported). Media Center was included in the Windows 7 Home Premium, Professional, Enterprise, and Ultimate editions. It is the principal distinction between the Windows 7 Home Basic and Windows 7 Home Premium editions. It became a paid-for add-on in Windows 8 and was discontinued in Windows 10.\n\nIf Media Center is not available, a DVD player is available from Microsoft. Third-party software is required to playback commercial Blu-ray™ discs.\ntag:C2 L1 TA

32-BIT AND 64-BIT WINDOWS\n\nEach version and edition of Windows is available as 32-bit or 64-bit (x64) software. 64- bit editions of Windows can run most 32-bit applications software, though there may be some exceptions (you should check with the software vendor). The reverse is not true, however; a 32-bit version of Windows cannot run 64-bit applications software.\n\n64-bit editions of Windows also require 64-bit hardware device drivers authorized ("signed") by Microsoft. If the vendor has not produced a 64-bit driver, the hardware device will not be usable.\ntag:C2 L1 TA

WINDOWS SYSTEM LIMITS\n\nThe versions and editions of Windows have different restrictions in terms of CPU types and features and memory supported. Windows 10 has the following system limits:\n\n(https://4sorcero.s3.amazonaws.com/byteback/core_2/table_core_2_8a.png)\n\nWindows 8 has the following system limits:\n\n(https://4sorcero.s3.amazonaws.com/byteback/core_2/table_core_2_8b.png)\n\nWindows 7 has the following system limits:\n\n(https://4sorcero.s3.amazonaws.com/byteback/core_2/table_core_2_8c.png)\n(https://4sorcero.s3.amazonaws.com/byteback/core_2/table_core_2_9.png)\n\nThe Windows 7 Starter edition was only available to system builders (OEMs) for installation on netbooks and sub-notebooks. It supports up to 2 GB RAM. There is no 64-bit version of the Starter edition.\ntag:C2 L1 TA

OS LIFECYCLES\n\nAn end of life system is one that is no longer supported by its developer or vendor. End of life systems no longer receive security updates and so represent a critical vulnerability for a company’s security systems if any remain in active use.\n\nMicrosoft products are subject to a support lifecycle policy. Windows versions are given five years of mainstream support and five years of extended support (during Which only security updates are shipped). Support is contingent on the latest Service Pack being applied (non-updated versions of Windows are supported for 24 months following the release of the SP). Windows 10 retirement schedules for feature updates—referred to as "end of service"—are 18 months, except for September updates for Education/Enterprise editions only, which are supported for 30 months.\n\nTo find out when Microsoft products will be retired or how long specific products will be supported, visit the Microsoft Product Lifecycle Search tool at support.microsoft.com/lifecycle/search.\n\nWhen you plan to install a new version of an operating system as an upgrade, you must check that your computer meets the hardware requirements for the new version. ‘As operating system software such as Windows 10 moves towards more of a service model, with quite frequent feature updates, it could be the case that an update has its ‘own system requirements that were different from the original. Plus, Microsoft points ‘out that the core hardware requirements for Windows 10 are the same as those for Windows 7. Other factors might impact your ability to apply a feature update, including support for third-party driver or applications software.\ntag:C2 L1 TA

APPLE OPERATING SYSTEMS\n\nIn 1984, when the IBM PC was the dominant desktop standard, Steve Jobs and Steve Wozniak created a new type of personal computer—the Apple® Macintosh® (or Mac®). It was revolutionary because it came with a graphical user interface at a time when IBM's PC used the command-line/text menu DOS operating system. The Mac has never matched Windows' huge user base, although its current incarnation does have a truly devoted following.\n\nAPPLE MAC OS/OS X/macOS\n\nThe main difference between Mac OS and other operating systems is that the OS is only supplied with Apple-built computers. You cannot purchase Mac OS and install it on an ordinary PC. This helps to make Mac OS stable but does mean that there is far less choice in terms of buying extra hardware.\n\n(https://4sorcero.s3.amazonaws.com/byteback/core_2/fig_core_2_10.png)\nmacOS desktop. (Screenshot courtesy of Apple.)\n\nThe current lines—OS X® and more recently macOS®—were re-developed from the kernel of another type of operating system called UNIX. This kernel is supplemented with additional code to implement the Mac's graphical interface and system utilities and to maintain compatibility with older Mac OS applications. macOS gets periodic "dot" version updates. At the time of writing, the current version is 10.14 or "Mojave," and updates are being released to existing customers free-of-charge.\n\nAs there is a tight link between the models of Mac computers and the OS, Apple makes specific update limitations about whether a new version of macOS can be installed to a Mac computer. Check support.apple.com for the technical specification for any particular macOS release. Apple does not publish end of life policies.\n\nAPPLE iOS\niOS is the operating system for Apple's iPhone  smartphone and iPad  tablet. While also derived from UNIX, iOS is a closed source operating system. This means that the code used to design the software is kept confidential and can only be modified by Apple. macOS and iOS have some similarities but they are not compatible; an app developed for iOS will not run on macOS.\n\nOn an iOS device, apart from volume and power, the only external button is the Home key, which returns the user to the home screen "desktop."\n\nThe interface is then entirely controlled via touch. Point to icons to open apps, swipe or flick from left-to-right to access the keyboard and search, or flick right-to-left to view more icons. Re-arrange icons by tapping and holding for a few seconds. The icons will then "wobble" and can be dragged to a different page or into the dock taskbar at the bottom. Press the Home key to save.\n\nTo view and manage open apps, double-click the Home key to open the Multitasking bar.\n\n(https://4sorcero.s3.amazonaws.com/byteback/core_2/fig_core_2_11.png)\niOS 11 running on an iPhone 7. (Screenshot courtesy of Apple.)\n\nTouch can be operated either with your fingers or with a special soft-touch stylus. There are many more gestures in addition to those listed above. For example, shaking the device is often used to activate undo. There are also external keyboards available and most Apple devices support Siri®, a voice recognition system and personal assistant.\n\nNew versions are released approximately every year with various .x updates. Version 12 is current at time of writing. Apple makes new versions freely available, though older hardware devices may not support all the features of a new version, or may not be supported at all.As with macOS, update limitations are published at support.apple.com but there are no end of life policies.\ntag:C2 L1 TA

UNIX-BASED OPERATING SYSTEMS\n\nWindows and macOS dominate the desktop/workstation/laptop market, but a third "family" of operating systems is very widely used on a larger range of devices.\n\nUNIX\nUNIX is a trademark for a family of operating systems originally developed at Bell\nLaboratories beginning in the late 1960s. All UNIX® systems share a kernel/shell architecture, with the kernel providing the core functionality and the interchangeable shells providing the user interface. Unlike Windows and macOS, UNIX is portable to different hardware platforms; versions of UNIX can run on everything from personal computers to mainframes and on many types of computer processors.\n\nLINUX\nOriginally developed by Linus Torvalds, Linux is based on UNIX. UNIX was developed over decades by various commercial, academic, and not-for-profit organizations. This resulted in several versions, not all of which are compatible, and many of which are proprietary or contain copyrighted or patented code or features. Linux® was developed as a fully open source alternative to UNIX (and for that matter, to Windows and macOS and iOS).\n\n(https://4sorcero.s3.amazonaws.com/byteback/core_2/fig_core_2_12.png)\nUbuntu Linux.\n\nLinux can be used as a desktop or server OS. There are many distributions or distros, notably SUSE®, Red Hat®, CentOS, Fedora®, Debian®, Ubuntu®, and Mint®. Each distro adds specific packages and interfaces to the generic Linux kernel and provides different support options. Linux does not require a graphical interface, though many distributions provide one.\n\nIBM®, Sun/Oracle®, and Novell® are among the vendors producing end-user applications for Linux. As a desktop OS it tends to be used in schools and universities more than in business or in the home. As a server OS, it dominates the market for web servers. It is also used very widely as the OS for "smart" appliances and Internet of Things (IoT) devices.\n\nCHROME OS\nChrome OS is derived from Linux, via an open source OS called Chromium™. Chrome OS™ itself is proprietary. Chrome OS is developed by Google to run on specific laptop (Chromebook) and PC (Chromebox) hardware. This hardware is designed for the budget and education markets.\n\nChrome OS was primarily developed to use web applications. In a web application, the software is hosted on a server on the Internet and the client connects to it using a browser. The client computer does not need to be particularly powerful as the server does most of the processing. Chrome OS provides a minimal environment compared to Windows. This means that there is less chance of some other software application or hardware device driver interfering with the function of the browser.\n\nThere are also "packaged" apps available for use offline and Chrome OS can run apps developed for Android.\n\nANDROID\nAndroid is a smartphone/tablet OS developed by the Open Handset Alliance, primarily driven by Google. Unlike iOS, it is an open-source OS, based on Linux. The software code is made publicly available (source.android.com). This means that there is more scope for hardware vendors, such as Acer®, Asus®, HTC®, Huawei®, LG, Motorola®, OnePlus, Oppo™, Samsung®, Sony®, and Xiamoi to produce vendor-specific versions.\n\n(https://4sorcero.s3.amazonaws.com/byteback/core_2/fig_core_2_13.png)\nAndroid lollipop home screen.\n\nLike iOS, Android is updated with new major (1.x) and minor (x.1) versions, each of which is named after some kind of sweet stuff. At the time of writing, current versions include 7.1 (Nougat) and 8.1 (Oreo). Because handset vendors produce their own editions of Android, device compatibility for new versions is more mixed compared with iOS.\n\nEnd of life policies and update restrictions for particular handsets are determined by the handset vendor rather than any kind of overall Android authority. Companies ordering handsets in bulk as employee devices may be able to obtain their own guarantees.\ntag:C2 L1 TA

Topic B\nUse Windows Features and Tools\n\nEXAM OBJECTIVES COVERED\n1002-1.4 Given a scenario, use appropriate Microsoft command tine tools.\n1002-15 Given a scenario, use Microsoft operating system features and tools.\n1002-1.6 Given a scenario, use Microsoft Windows Control Panel utilities.\n1002-2.6 Compare and contrast the differences of basic Microsoft Windows OS security settings.\n\nAs an administrator, you will manage the computer through a graphic user interface (GU) for some tasks and through a command line interface for others. In this topic, you will examine some of the administrative tools and utilities for Windows computers.\n\nWhen you configure or troubleshoot a computer, you need to do so with an account that has sufficient privileges to make major changes to OS settings and files. If misused, these privileges could be a significant threat to the security of the computer system and network. In this topic, you will also learn how to exercise administrative privileges safely.\ntag:C2 L1 TB

WINDOWS SETTINGS AND CONTROL PANEL\n\nMany tools are used to configure Windows settings and hardware devices. Some of the tools are accessible to ordinary users; others need administrative privileges to run.\ntag:C2 L1 TB

CONTROL PANEL\n\nIn Windows 7, the Control Panel is the best place to start configuring your system. The icons in the Control Panel represent applets used to configure a part of the system.\n\n(https://4sorcero.s3.amazonaws.com/byteback/core_2/fig_core_2_16.png)\nWindows 7 Control Panel showing 1) Task groups; 2) Configuration applets; 3) Navigation breadcrumb; 4) Search box. (Screenshot used with permission from Microsoft)\n\nMost applets are added by Windows but some software applications, such as antivirus software, add their own applets. Configuration information entered via Control Panel is ultimately stored in the Windows registry database.\n\nYou can access Control Panel through the Start Menu. In addition, certain applets are accessible by viewing object properties straight from the desktop or from Explorer. Control Panel applets are arranged by category by default, although you can display “All items" via the breadcrumb or the "View by" menu. Note that options with the icon on or next to them will require you to authorize use of the command through User Account Control (UAC). \ntag:C2 L1 TB

WINDOWS SETTINGS\n\nWindows Settings is a touchscreen-enabled “app” interface for managing a Windows 10 computer.\n\n(https://4sorcero.s3.amazonaws.com/byteback/core_2/fig_core_2_17.png)\nWindows Settings app. (Screenshot used with permission from Microsoft)\n\nMost of the standard Windows 10 configuration settings can be located within Windows Settings, but not all of them. Some options are still configured via Control Panel. Each Windows 10 feature update tends to move more configuration options from Control Panel to Windows Settings, though.\n\nNote: In Windows 8, this app is referred to as "PC Settings" and is accessed via the Charms bar.\ntag:C2 L1 TB

USER ACCOUNTS\n\nA user account is the principal means of controlling access to computer and network resources and rights or privileges. Resources include access to files, folders, or printers; rights or privileges refers to the ability to make configuration changes or read/modify a data file. Each resource is configured with an access list, which is alist of users and their permissions for that resource.\n\nA user account is protected by authenticating the account owner—making them provide some data that is known or held only by them.\n\nEach user account is also associated with a profile, stored in a subfolder of the Users folder. The profile contains per-user registry settings (ntuser.dat) and the default document folders. Software applications might also write configuration information to the profile.\ntag:C2 L1 TB

ADMINISTRATOR AND STANDARD USER ACCOUNTS\n\nWhen the OS is first installed, the account created or used during setup is a powerful local administrator account. The account is assigned membership of the local Administrators group. Generally speaking, you should only use this account to manage the computer—install applications and devices, perform troubleshooting, and so on.\n\nYou should create ordinary user accounts for day-to-day access to the computer. This is done by putting additional users of the computer in the Standard users group. Standard users cannot change the system configuration and are restricted to saving data files within their own user profile folder or the Public profile. For example, a user named David with standard privileges could save files only within C:\Users\David or \Users\Public. Administrators can access any folder on the computer.\n\nNote: Windows protects system folders from non-root administrative users. These folders are owned by a system account (such as Trustedinstaller). This provides more protection against malware and misconfiguration. It is possible for any administrator account to take ownership of a system folder and override these protections, though.\ntag:C2 L1 TB

USER ACCOUNT MANAGEMENT\n\nThe User Accounts applet in Control Panel allows users to manage their accounts. Users can manage local and network passwords and choose a picture to represent them on the log on screen.\n\n(https://4sorcero.s3.amazonaws.com/byteback/core_2/fig_core_2_18.png)\nUser Accounts applet in Windows 7. (Screenshot used with permission from Microsoft)\n\nAdministrators can create and delete accounts or change the type of account (between administrator and user).\n\nLOCAL AND MICROSOFT ACCOUNTS\nIn Windows 8 and Windows 10, the User Accounts applet is still present and can still be used to change an account name or type, but it cannot be used to create new accounts. That function, plus most other account functions, is performed in the Accounts section of Windows Settings. Windows 8/10 accounts can either be local accounts (like Windows 7 user accounts) or linked to a Microsoft account, which gives access to Microsoft's cloud services and syncs desktop settings across multiple devices.\n\n(https://4sorcero.s3.amazonaws.com/byteback/core_2/fig_core_2_20.png)\nCreating a new account. (Screenshot used with permission from Microsoft.)\ntag:C2 L1 TB

UAC\n\nUser Account Control (UAC) is a solution to the problem of elevated privileges. In order to change important settings on the computer, such as installing drivers or software, administrative privileges are required. Previous versions of Windows make dealing with typical administrative tasks as an ordinary user very difficult, meaning that most users were given administrative privileges as a matter of course. This makes the OS more usable but it also makes it much more vulnerable, as any malicious software infecting the computer would run with the same administrative privileges.\n\nUAC SECURE DESKTOP\nAccounts with administrative privileges are mediated by UAC. UAC counters the problem of escalated privileges by first extending some system privileges to ordinary users but then running accounts in a sandbox mode. Tasks that require UAC are shown with a Security Shield icon.\n\n(https://4sorcero.s3.amazonaws.com/byteback/core_2/fig_core_2_20a.png)\nSecurity Shield icon showing that changing this setting will require UAC authorization. (Screenshot used with permission from Microsoft.)\nWhen a user needs to exercise administrative rights, she or he must explicitly confirm use of those rights:\n• If the logged in account has standard privileges, an administrator's credentials must be entered via the authorization dialog box.\n• If the logged in account is already an administrator, the user must still click through the authorization dialog box.\n\nThe desktop darkens into a special secure desktop mode to prevent third-party software from imitating the authorization dialog box.\n\n(https://4sorcero.s3.amazonaws.com/byteback/core_2/fig_core_2_20b.png)\nUAC requiring confirmation of the use of administrator privileges. This account is an administrator so only a confirmation is required—no credentials have to be supplied. (Screenshot used with permission from Microsoft.)\n\nCONFIGURING UAC\nUAC protects the system from malware running with elevated administrator privileges. This is a good thing, but if you need to perform numerous system administration tasks at the same time, UAC can prove frustrating. You can configure UAC notifications to appear more or less frequently by using the configuration option in the User Accounts applet.\n\n(https://4sorcero.s3.amazonaws.com/byteback/core_2/fig_core_2_21a.png)\nConfiguring UAC notifications. (Screenshot used with permission from Microsoft.)\ntag:C2 L1 TB

ADMINISTRATIVE TOOLS\n\nOne of the options in Control Panel is the Administrative Tools shortcut.\n\n(https://4sorcero.s3.amazonaws.com/byteback/core_2/fig_core_2_21b.png)\nAdministrative Tools in Windows 7. (Screenshot used with permission from Microsoft.)\n\nAdministrative Tools contains several shortcuts, giving you the ability to define and configure various advanced system settings and processes. There are also tools to assist with troubleshooting the system.\ntag:C2 L1 TB

DEFAULT MICROSOFT MANAGEMENT CONSOLES\n\nAdministrative Tools is a collection of pre-defined Microsoft Management Consoles (MMCs). Each console contains one or more snap-ins that are used to modify various settings. The principal consoles are:\n• Component Services—enables you to register new server applications or reconfigure security permissions for existing services.\n• Computer Management—the default management console with multiple snap-ins to configure local users and groups, disks, services, devices, and so on.\n\n(https://4sorcero.s3.amazonaws.com/byteback/core_2/fig_core_2_22.png)\nThe default Computer Management console in Windows 10 with the configuration snap-ins shown (on the left. (Screenshot used with permission from Microsoft)\n\n• Data Sources—control connections to databases set up on the local computer.\n• Event Viewer—allows monitoring of Windows logs. System, security, and application events are recorded in these logs. There are also application- and service-specific logs.\n• Local Security Policy—allows you to view and edit the current security policy. A computer that is a member of a domain will have the security settings defined in the domain security policy.\n• Print Management—set properties and monitor local printers and manage printer sharing on the network.\n• Reliability and Performance Monitoring—view the performance of the local computer.\n• Services—start, stop, and pause services.\n\nNote: Windows 10 adds quite a few more shortcuts under Administrative Tools, including Disk Cleanup, System Configuration, System Information, and Task Scheduler.\ntag:C2 L1 TB

MMC CUSTOMIZATION\n\nAs well as using the default consoles, you may find it useful to create your own. Consoles can be configured for each administrator and the details saved as a file with an MSC extension in their Start Menu folders.\n\nNote: Most MMC snap-ins can be used to manage either the local computer or a remote computer (a computer elsewhere on the network)\n\n(https://4sorcero.s3.amazonaws.com/byteback/core_2/fig_core_2_23.png)\nAdding a Snap-in in Windows 7. (Screenshot used with permission from Microsoft.)\ntag:C2 L1 TB

ACCESS OPTIONS FOR SYSTEM TOOLS\n\nControl Panel and Administrative Tools contain most of the shortcuts for the system features, but there are other ways of accessing key tools.\n\nCOMPUTER/THIS PC\nThe Computer object (renamed This PC in Windows 8/10) provides access to your local drives, printers, and any network drives that have been mapped. To browse resources, open Computer/This PC then the icon that represents the resource you want to view.\n\nBy right-clicking the icon itself and selecting the Properties option from the menu, you can access System properties. You can also right-click and select Manage to open the default Computer Management console.\n\nWinX/POWER USERS MENU\nPressing Windows+X or right-clicking the Start button shows a shortcut menu including Control Panel, Windows Settings, and File Explorer, but also management utilities such as Device Manager, Computer Management, Command Prompt, and Windows PowerShell®.\n\n(https://4sorcero.s3.amazonaws.com/byteback/core_2/fig_core_2_24a.png)\nWindows 10 Winx menu (right-click the Start button). (Screenshot used with permission from Microsoft)\n\nNote: Contents of the Winx menu do change frequently. For example, the Control Panel link is no longer included in Windows 10 (1803).\ntag:C2 L1 TB

INSTANT SEARCH BOX AND RUN COMMAND\n\nThe Instant Search box on the Start Menu/Start Screen will execute programs and configuration options using simple names. You can open any file or program by pressing the Windows key then typing the path to the file. In the case of registered programs and utilities, you simply need to type the program file name or utility name. ‘Alternatively, you can access the Run dialog box using Windows+R or entering run into the search box.\n\n(https://4sorcero.s3.amazonaws.com/byteback/core_2/fig_core_2_24b.png)\nRun dialog box. (Screenshot used with permission from Microsoft.)\n\nNote: The run command is useful if you want to execute a program with switches that modify the operation of the software. For example, Microsoft Office programs can be executed using safe mode switches for troubleshooting.\n\n.MSC EXTENSIONS AND THE RUN LINE\nThere are several management consoles that you can access via the Run line by using the .MSC extension. For example:\n• devmgmt .msc opens the Device Manager console.\n• diskmgmt .msc opens the Disk Management console.\n• compmgmt .msc opens the Computer Management console.\ntag:C2 L1 TB

COMMAND LINE TOOLS\n\nMost configuration of Windows can be done via convenient GUI tools, such as the management consoles and Control Panel. In some circumstances, though, it is necessary to use a command prompt to configure or troubleshoot a system. As you learn the commands, you may also find it quicker to use the command shell for actions such as file management. Learning commands is also valuable if you have to write scripts to automate Windows.\n\nCOMMAND PROMPT\nYou can run any command from the Run dialog box. However, to input a series of commands or to view output from commands, you need to use the command shell (cmd .exe). To open the prompt, type cmd in the Run dialog box or Instant Search box.\n\nNote: Alternatively, you can type command to achieve the same thing. This used to be specifically a DOS command interpreter, but now just links to cmd.exe.\n\nYou may need to run the command prompt with elevated privileges in order to execute a command. If a command cannot be run, the error message "The requested operation requires elevation” is displayed.\n\n(https://4sorcero.s3.amazonaws.com/byteback/core_2/fig_core_2_25.png)\nTrying to run a command that requires elevation. You must open a new command prompt window as administrator. (Screenshot used with permission from Microsoft.)\n\nYou cannot continue within the same window. You need to open a new command prompt as administrator. Right-click the command prompt shortcut and select Run as administrator then confirm the UAC prompt. Alternatively, type cmd in the Instant Search box then press Ctrl+Shift+Enter.\n\n(https://4sorcero.s3.amazonaws.com/byteback/core_2/fig_core_2_26a.png)\nOpening an elevated command prompt. (Screenshot used with permission from Microsoft.)\n\nWhen run as administrator, the title bar shows "Administrator: Command Prompt" and the default folder is C:\Windows\System32 rather than C:\Users\Username.\n\n(https://4sorcero.s3.amazonaws.com/byteback/core_2/fig_core_2_26b.png)\nElevated command prompt. (Screenshot used with permission from Microsoft)\n\nNote: You can use this technique to open utilities, such as Explorer or Notepad with administrative privileges,\n\nCOMMAND SYNTAX\nTo run a command, type it at the prompt (>) using the command name and any switches and arguments using the proper syntax. When you have typed the command, press Enter to execute it.\n\nThe syntax of a command lists which arguments you must use (plus ones that are optional) and the effect of the different switches. Switches are usually preceded by the forward slash escape character.\n\nNote: If an argument includes a space, it may need to be entered within quotes (" ").\n\nAs you enter commands, the prompt fills up with text. If this is distracting, you can use the cle command to clear the screen.\n\nSome commands, such as nslookup or telnet, can operate in interactive mode. This means that using the command starts that program and from that point, the prompt will only accept input relevant to the program. To exit the program you use the wxit or quit command (or press Ctrl+C). The exit  command will close the cmd window if not used within an interactive command.\n\nGETTING HELP\nThe command prompt includes a rudimentary help system. If you type   at the command prompt then press Enter, a list of available commands is displayed. If you enter help CommandName, help on that command is displayed, listing the syntax and switches used for the command. You can also display help on a particular command by using the /? switch (for example, netstat /? displays help on the netstat command).\n\n(https://4sorcero.s3.amazonaws.com/byteback/core_2/fig_core_2_27.png)\nHelp on the netstat command. (Screenshot used with permission from Microsoft.)\n\nTEXT EDITORS\nMany files used by the operating system and applications are in a binary file format that can only be interpreted by the application. A plain text file can be modified in any text editor, but if it is saved through an application other than a basic text editor, it could be converted to a binary format and so become unusable. Windows supplies the basic text editor Notepad to modify text files. There are many third-party alternatives with better features, however.\n\nRUN COMMAND\nYou can also execute commands from Instant Search or from the Run dialog box. If a command is interactive, it will open a command prompt window for input. If a command is non-interactive, the command prompt window will open briefly and close again as the command executes. If you want to force a command into interactive mode, use the cmd _/k keyword before the command (for example, cmd /k ipconfig).\ntag:C2 L1 TB

WINDOWS SHUTDOWN OPTIONS\n\nWhen the user wants to finish using Windows, simply disconnecting the power runs a risk of losing data or corrupting system files. There are various choices for closing or suspending a session:\n• Shut down (/s)—close all open programs and services before powering off the computer. The user should save changes in any open files first but will be prompted to save any open files during shut down.\n• Standby/Sleep—save the current session to memory and put the computer into a minimal power state.\n• Hibernate (/h)—save the current session to disk before powering off the computer. \n• Log off (/1}—close all open programs and services started under the user account but leave the computer running.\n• Switch user—tog on to another user account, leaving programs and files under the current account open.\n• Lock—secure the desktop with a password while leaving programs running.\n• Restart (/r)—close all open programs and services before rebooting without powering down. This is also called a soft reset.\n\nThese options can be selected from the Start Menu/Start Screen or by pressing Ctrl+Alt+Del.\n\n(https://4sorcero.s3.amazonaws.com/byteback/core_2/fig_core_2_28.png)\nOptions on the Windows 7 power button. (Screenshot used with permission from Microsoft.)\n\nNote: One of the "quirks" of Windows 8.0 was the lack of an ovious way to select the Shut Down command. Microsoft expected users to just use the physical power button, which on a modern computer invokes a shut down command (soft power) rather than a hard reset (unless you keep the power button pressed down). Users were reluctant to adopt this method, no doubt following years of IT departments telling them not to turn off a computer that way. The power options in Windows 8.0 are accessed via the Charms bar. The Stare button and a power button on the Start Screen was returned in 8.1. In Windows 10, it appears right above the Start button, where no one can miss it.\n\nThe computer can also be shut down at a command prompt by using the shut down ‘command plus the relevant switch (shown in the previous figure). If a shutdown is in progress, shutdown /a aborts it (if used quickly enough). The /t nn switch can be used to specify delay seconds before shutdown starts; the default is 30 seconds.\ntag:C2 L1 TB

THE WINDOWS REGISTRY\n\nThe Windows registry provides a remotely accessible database for storing operating system, device, and Software application configuration information. When you boot a Windows machine, the registry is populated with information about hardware detected in your system. During boot, Windows extracts information from the registry, such as which device drivers to load and in what order. Device drivers also send and receive data from the registry. The drivers receive load parameters and configuration data. Finally, whenever you run a setup program or configure the system via Control Panel/Settings or Administrative Tools, it will add or change data in the registry.\n\nThe registry does have a dedicated tool called regedit for direct editing, but itis not the tool you would use on an everyday basis to modify configuration data. Control Panel/Settings and Administrative Tools are better options for most tasks.\n\nREGISTRY STRUCTURE\nThe registry is structured as a set of five root keys that contain computer and user databases. The computer database includes information about hardware and software installed on the computer. The user database includes the information in user profiles, such as desktop settings, individual preferences for certain software, and personal printer and network settings.\n\n(https://4sorcero.s3.amazonaws.com/byteback/core_2/table_core_2_29a.png)\n\nHKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE: Hardware information such as bus type, system memory, device drivers, and startup control data. HKLM also contains the Security Accounts Manager (SAM) password file (not viewable) and system-wide software settings.\n\nHKEY_CLASSES_ROOT: Object Linking And Embedding (OLE) and file association data.\n\nHKEY_CURRENT_USER: Contains the profile for the user who is currently logged on, including environment variables, desktop settings, network connections, printers, and application preferences.\n\nHKEY_USERS: Contains all actively loaded user profiles, including HKEY_CURRENT_ USER, which always refers to a child of HKEY_USERS, and the default profile.\n\nHKEY_CURRENT_CONFIG: Contains system and software configuration information specific to this session.\ntag:C2 L1 TB

SUBKEYS AND VALUES\n\nEach root key can contain subkeys and data items called value entries. Subkeys are analogous to folders and the value entries are analogous to files. A value entry has three parts: the name of the value, the data type of the value, and the value itself. The following table lists the different data types.\n\n(https://4sorcero.s3.amazonaws.com/byteback/core_2/table_core_2_29b.png)\n(https://4sorcero.s3.amazonaws.com/byteback/core_2/table_core_2_30.png)\n\nREG_BINARY: Raw binary data. Most hardware component information is stored as binary data and displayed in hex format.\n\nREG_DWORD: Data represented by a 4-byte number. Many parameters for device drivers and services are this type and can be displayed in binary, hex, or decimal format.\n\nREG SZ: string or sequence of characters representing human- readable text.\n\nREG_MULTISZ: A multiple string. Values that contain lists or multiple text values are usually this type. Entries are separated by NULL characters.\n\nREG_EXPAND_SZ: An expandable data string, which is text that contains a variable to be replaced when called by an application. For example, the string %SystemRoot% would be replaced by the actual location of the folder containing the Windows system files.\n\nREGISTRY DATABASE FILES\nThe registry database is stored in binary files called hives. A hive comprises a single file (with no extension), a .LOG file (containing a transaction log), and a .SAV file (a copy of the key as it was at the end of setup). The system hive also has an .ALT backup file, Most of these files are stored in the %SystemRoot%\System32\Config folder, but hive files for user profiles are stored in the folder holding the user's profile. The following table shows the standard hives.\n\nHKEY_CURRENT_CONFIG: system, system.allt, system.log, system.sav\nHKEY_CURRENT_USER: ntuser.dat, ntuser.dat.log\nHKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SAM: ssam, sam.log, sam.saw.\nHKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SECURITY: security, security.log, security.sav\nHKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE: software, software.log, software.sav\nHKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM: system, system.alt, system.log, system.sav\nHKEY_USERS\.DEFAULT: default, default.log, default.sav\nHKEY_CLASSES_ROOT: Not stored in a hive but built from the \SOFTWARE \CLASSES keys in CURRENT_USER and LOCAL_MACHINE\n\nEDITING THE REGISTRY\nYou can start the Registry Editor by running regedit via Instant Search, the Run dialog box, or the command prompt. You can use it to view or edit the registry and to back up and restore portions of the registry.\n\nUse the Find tool (Ctrl+F) to search for a key or value. If you want to copy portions of the registry database and use them on other computers, select File—Export Registry File. The file will be exported in a registry-compatible format and can be merged into another computer's registry by double-clicking the file (or calling it from a script).\n\n(https://4sorcero.s3.amazonaws.com/byteback/core_2/fig_core_2_31a.png)\nEditing the registry. (Screenshot used with permission from Microsoft.)\n\nA registration file is a plain text file. If you merge changes from a .reg file back to the registry, additions that you have made to the registry will not be overwritten.\n\n(https://4sorcero.s3.amazonaws.com/byteback/core_2/fig_core_2_31b.png)\nSelecting a file format for exporting a registry key. (Screenshot used with permission from Microsoft.)\n\nUse the Registry Hive Files format to create a binary copy of that portion of the registry. Restoring from the binary file will remove any additions you made, as well as reversing the changes.\ntag:C2 L1 TB

Activity 1-3\nUsing Windows Features and Tools\n\nBEFORE YOU BEGIN\nThe hands-on activities in this course use Virtual Machines (VMs) within the Hyper-V hypervisor. The VMs have been pre-installed on your HOST computer. Your instructor will explain how to sign-on to the HOST computer.\n\nIf you are confident, try to complete the numbered steps independently. If you need guidance in completing a task, refer to the lettered sub-steps.\n\nSCENARIO\nIn the first part of this activity, you will compare the desktop styles of Windows 10, Windows 7, and Windows 8.1. Think about which version you would recommend to a corporate client, based on ease of use. Later in the activity, you will identify the admin tools best suited to particular tasks and how to access them.\n\nNote: Activities may vary slightly ifthe software vendor has issued digital updates. Your instructor will notify you of any changes.\n\n1. Use Hyper-V Manager to start the PC1 VM and sign on using the account Admin and password Password.\n\na) Click in the Instant Search box and type hyperv.\n\nb) Select the icon for Hyper-V Manager in the search results.\n\nc) In the Virtual Machines panel, right-click PC1 and select Start.\n\nd) Double-click the VM to open the connection window.\n\n(https://4sorcero.s3.amazonaws.com/byteback/core_2/fig_core_2_35.png)\n\nYou can start, stop, or configure each VM through its own connection window in Hyper-V ‘Manager. (Screenshot used with permission from Microsoft)\n\ne) With the user name Admin shown, click in the box and type PaSSw0rd and then press. Enter to sign on.\n\nWindows 10 boots to the desktop. This is the default behavior for a PC (or VM). Tablet mode boots to the Start Screen. This mode is selected automatically on tablet hardware, or you can apply it using Notification icon—-Tablet mode.\n\nf) On the taskbar, select the Notification icon Blo view the options.\n\ng) Select the Start button and explore the layout of the Start Screen.\n\nThe first column contains shortcuts to frequently used settings and folder locations. The middle pane lists all apps installed on the computer. The last pane can be configured with app tile shortcuts and live file.\n\n2. Start the PC2 VM and sign on using the account Admin and Password for the password. Compare the Windows 7 desktop to Windows 10.\n\na) Select the Hyper-V Manager window. In the Virtual Machines panel, right click PC2 and select Start. Double-click the VM to open the connection window.\n\nb) Press Ctrl+Alt+End to show the sign-on screen.\n\nNote: When the mouse is within the VM window, keyboard commands work on the VM, not on the HOST. The only exception is that pressing Cerl+Alt+Del while in the VM does send the command to the host, so in the VM, you need to press Ctrl+Alt+End in instances where you would normally press Ctrl+Alt+Del\n\nc) Select Switch User, then select Other User to use a different account to the one \nshown initially.\n\nd) In the User name box, type .\dmin, Type PaSSwOrd in the Password box and then press Enter.\n\nThis VM is joined to a domain but the domain server is not started. Using .\ tells Windows to use a local account for authentication, rather than the domain server.\n\n©) Compare the Windows 7 desktop and taskbar to the Windows 10 desktop.\n\nf) On PC2, select the Start button and explore the layout of the Start Menu. Observe the links to the configuration applets and the shortcuts in the All Programs submenu.\n\n3. Start the Windows 8.1 VM and sign on with the same account details as you used previously. Compare the Windows 8.1 desktop to Windows 7 and Windows 10.\n\na) Start the PC3 VM and open a connection window.\n\nb) Sign on to the Admin account using the PaSSwOrd credential.\n\nThis Windows 8.1 build boots to the Start Screen. Also, you might see a tip showing, how to access the Charms bar.\n\nc) See if you can follow the tip instructions to show the Charms bar—move the cursor to the top-right corner of the connection window and then pull down. If you struggle with this, press Windows+C instead.\n\nd) From the Charms bar, select Settings. Note the Power icon.\n\nLater patches for Windows 8.1 include the Power icon at the top of the Start Screen.\n\ne) Press the Windows key to toggle between the Start Screen and desktop.\n\nf) With the desktop showing, right-click the taskbar and select Properties. Select the Navigation tab. Note the option to boot to the desktop rather than the Start Screen. Select Cancel.\n\ng) Show the Start Screen again. Move the mouse to the bottom of the window and, select the arrow that appears.\n\nThis shows all the apps installed on the computer.\n\nh) Examine some of the differences to Windows 10.\n\nIn Windows 10, the account options and access to the power button and settings are more conveniently placed on the left of the Start Screen. is also easier to browse the All Apps list.\n\nYou won't use Windows 8.0 in these activities, but you should be aware that this version of Windows shipped without a Start button,\n\n(https://4sorcero.s3.amazonaws.com/byteback/core_2/fig_core_2_37.png)\nThis is the Windows 8.0 desktop—note the lack of a Start button. (Screenshot used with permission from Microsoft.)\n\n4. Use the Windows 10 VM to create a new standard user account. Sign on with the ew account and try to escalate the account privileges to trigger a UAC prompt.\n\na) Switch to the PC1 connection window.

Topic C\nManage Files in Windows\n\nEXAM OBJECTIVES COVERED\n1002-1.4 Given a scenario, use appropriate Microsoft command line tools.\n1002-1.5 Given a scenario, use Microsoft operating system features and tools.\n1002-1.6 Given a scenario, use Microsoft Windows Control Panel utiles.\n1002-2.6 Compare and contrast the differences of basic Microsoft Windows OS security settings.\n\nFile management is a critical part of using a computer. As a computer support professional, you will often have to assist users with locating files. You should also be familiar with the Windows system folders and know how to perform file management at the command prompt as well as the GUI.\ntag:C2 L1 TC

WINDOWS FILE AND FOLDER MANAGEMENT TOOLS\n\nFile Explorer provides hierarchical access to the system objects, drives, folders, and files stored on the computer. Explorer enables you to open, copy, move, rename, view, and delete files and folders.\n\nNote: File Explorer was previously called “Windows Explorer." tis often just referred to as "Explorer," as the process is run from the file explorer.exe.\n\n(https://4sorcero.s3.amazonaws.com/byteback/core_2/fig_core_2_41.png)\nFile Explorer in Windows 10. (Screenshot used with permission from Microsoft.)\n\nExplorer appears as a two-paned window showing the hierarchical structure of your, system. The left pane shows folders and the right pane shows the contents of the currently selected folder. Arrow symbols are used to indicate parts of the hierarchy that can be expanded or collapsed.\n\nNote: You can navigate the whole thing using the keyboard. Use Tab and Shift+Tab to switch between panes. Use the Up and Down arrows to move between folders and Left and Right arrows to expand and collapse trees.\n\nThe basic principle is that ordinary users can write (save data files) only to their profile folders and a special public profile. All other areas of the file system are protected; accessible only to accounts with administrative privileges.\ntag:C2 L1 TC

SYSTEM HIERARCHIES IN WINDOWS VERSIONS\n\nIn Windows, system objects are organized in a hierarchy. While the system objects themselves remain much the same, their exact name and place in the hierarchy changes from Windows version to Windows version. The basic purpose of the system objects is to mediate user access to personal files stored within their own folder plus local drives and network shares.\n\nWINDOWS 7 SYSTEM HIERARCHY\nIn Windows 7, each profile folder contains subfolders for different types of files (documents, pictures, music, video, and so on). User access to the profile folder is. largely mediated through the Libraries feature. Libraries are virtual folders that can represent content saved in different locations in the file system and on different file systems. For example, a documents library could show the contents of the user's documents folder and a USB drive.\n\n(https://4sorcero.s3.amazonaws.com/byteback/core_2/fig_core_2_42.png)\nWindows 7 system objects. (Screenshot used with permission from Microsoft)\n\nThe Computer system object allows the user to explore the contents of any local drives attached to the PC. The Network and Homegroup objects show servers and their shared files and printers on the local network. Favorites is a place for users to add shortcuts to other folders or locations in the file system.\n\nWINDOWS 8 SYSTEM HIERARCHY\nIn Windows 8, the computer object is named This PC and contains the user's desktop, the main document folders (including a downloads folder for files saved via the browser), and any local drives. The Libraries feature is hidden by default. Network, Homegroup, and Favorites work in the same way as Windows 7. The top level may also contain the OneDrive® object, which allows access to a cloud-based storage folder linked to the user's Microsoft account.\n\n(https://4sorcero.s3.amazonaws.com/byteback/core_2/fig_core_2_43.png)\nWindows 8 system objects. (Screenshot used with permission from Microsoft.)\n\nWINDOWS 10 SYSTEM HIERARCHY When browsing the computer using File Explorer in Windows 10, two top-level categories are shown in the navigation pane. Quick access contains shortcuts to folders that are most useful (replacing Favorites). These can be modified by dragging and dropping. By default, it contains shortcuts to your personal Desktop, Downloads, Documents, and Pictures folders.\n\n(https://4sorcero.s3.amazonaws.com/byteback/core_2/fig_core_2_44.png)\nFile Explorer navigation pane showing top-level categories in Windows 10. (Screenshot used with permission from Microsoft.)\n\nThe second top-level category is the Desktop. Under the "Desktop" object, you can find the following categories:\n• OneDrive—if you sign into the computer with a Microsoft account, this shows the files and folders saved to your cloud storage service on the Internet. As you can see from the screenshot, other cloud service providers may add links here, too.\n• User account—the folders belonging to your account profile. For example, in the previous screenshot, the user account is listed as "James at CompTIA."\n• This PC—access to user-generated files in the user's profile plus the hard drives and removable storage drives available to the PC.\n• Libraries—these can be used to create views of folders and files stored in different locations and on different disks. As with Windows 8, Libraries may be hidden by default, unless the computer was upgraded from Windows 7.\n• Network—contains computers, shared folders, and shared printers available over the network.\n• Control Panel—options for configuring legacy Windows features. Most configuration is now performed via the Settings app rather than Control Panel.\n• Recycle Bin—provides an option for recovering files and folders that have been recently deleted.\ntag:C2 L1 TC

DRIVES, FOLDERS, AND FILES\n\nThe top-level categories in the navigation pane show "logical" system objects. Actual data storage is configured on one or more drives. Each drive can have folders and files stored on it.\n\nLOCAL DRIVES\nWithin the Computer/This PC object, drives are referred to by letters and optional labels. A "drive" can be a single physical disk or a partition on a disk. A drive can also point to a shared network folder "mapped" to a drive letter. By convention, the A: drive is the floppy disk (very rarely seen these days) and the C: drive is the partition on the primary fixed disk holding the Windows installation.\n\nEvery drive contains a directory called the root directory. The root directory is represented by the backslash (\). For example, the root directory of the C: drive is C:\. Below the root directory is a hierarchical structure of directories called subdirectories. A sample directory structure is shown in the diagram.\n\n(https://4sorcero.s3.amazonaws.com/byteback/core_2/fig_core_2_45.png)\nTypical Windows directory structure.\n\nFiles may be placed at each level but the root, and certain other folders are designated as system and protected from use by standard users. While it is possible to create subfolders off the root folder, it is much better to keep user data within the profile subfolder within "Users."\n\nFOLDER CREATION\nYou can use the shortcut or File menus to create a new folder within another object. Windows has various folder naming rules that must be followed when modifying the folder structure:\n• No two subfolders within the same folder may have the same name. Subfolders of different folders may have the same name, though.\n• Folder names may not contain the following reserved characters: \/:*?" <> |\n* The full path to an object (including any file name and extension) may not usually exceed 260 characters.\n\nA warning message is displayed if these rules are not followed and the user is prompted to enter a new folder name.\n\nNote: Folder and file names are case aware, which means that the system preserves case in the name as entered but does not regard the case as significant for operations such as detecting duplicate names or indexing.\n\nFILE CREATION\nFiles are the containers for the data that is used and modified through the operating system and applications. Files store either text or binary data. Text data is human-readable, while binary data can only be interpreted by a software application compatible with that file type. Most user-generated files are created via the Save command of an application.\n\nFiles follow a similar naming convention to folders, except that the last part of the file name represents a file extension, which describes what type of file it is. The extension is used by Windows to associate the file with an application. The extension is divided from the rest of the file name by a period. By convention, extensions were three characters, but there are many applications (such as Microsoft Office) that now  use four or more characters for the file extension. By default, the extension is not shown to the user.\n\nNote: You can use a period as part of the main part of the file name, too. Its the last period that delimits the file extension.\ntag:C2 L1 TC
  
SYSTEM FILES\n\nSystem files are the files that are required for the operating system to function. These files are typically hidden because their deletion can prevent the computer from working properly. For system files, both the file extension and the location of the file in the system hierarchy are important, as they help the computer recognize it as a system file.\n\nThe root directory of a typical Windows installation normally contains the following, files and subdirectories:\n• Windows—the system root, containing drivers, logs, add-in applications, system and registry files (notably the System32 subdirectory), fonts, and so on.\n\nNote: system32 contains most ofthe applications and utilities used to manage and configure Windows. This is true even of 64-bit versions of Windows. 32-bit Dynamic Link Libraries (DLL) running under 64-bit Windows are stored in the SYSWOW64 folder.\n\n• Program Files/Program Files (x86)—subdirectories for installed applications software. In 64-bit versions of Windows, a Program Files (x86) folder is created to store 32-bit applications.\n\n• Users—storage for users’ profile settings and data. Each user has a folder named after their user account. This subfolder contains NTUSER.DAT (registry data) plus subfolders for "Documents," "Music," "Pictures," "Downloads," "Saved Games,” "Searches," and so on. The profile folder also contains hidden subfolders used to store application settings and customizations, favorite links, shortcuts, temporary files, and so on. There is also a “Public” profile, which is used for sharing documents between users on the same computer. The Users folder also contains a subfolder called "Default," which is the template for new user profiles.\n\n• bootmgr—this file can present boot options when the computer starts. It reads information from the Boot Configuration Data (BCD) store, which is usually stored in a hidden System Reserved partition.\n\n• pagefile.sys—Virtual Memory pagefile. Virtual memory is used to store data used by running applications when there is not enough system memory (RAM).\n\nNote: in Windows 8 and Windows 10, you will also see a swapfile-sys file. This is used by Windows Store apps.\n\n• hiberfil.sys—image of memory contents saved when the computer is put into hibernation.\ntag:C2 L1 TC

FILE ATTRIBUTES\n\nA file's name is just one of its attributes. Other attributes include the date the file was created, accessed, or modified; its size; its description; and the following markers, which can be enabled or disabled.\n\n(https://4sorcero.s3.amazonaws.com/byteback/core_2/table_core_2_46.png)\n\nRead-only (R): Prevents changes being saved back to the file. The user will be prompted to create another file containing the modified data.\n\nHidden (H): Specifies whether the file is visible in the default view (itis possible to adjust Windows to display hidden files and folders, though).\n\nSystem (5): Specifies that the file should not be accessible to ordinary users.\n\nArchive (A): Shows whether a file has changed since the last backup.\n\nFiles stored on a drive formatted using the NTFS file system have extended attributes, including permissions, compression, and encryption.\ntag:C2 L1 TC

PERMISSIONS\n\nTo view, create, modify, or delete a file in a folder, you need the correct permissions on that folder. Permissions can also be applied t ual files. Administrators can obtain full permissions over any file, but standard users can generally only view and modify files stored either in their profile or in the public profile. If a user attempts to view or save a file with insufficient permissions to do so, Windows displays an Access Denied error message.\n\nCustom permissions can be configured for a file or folder using the Security tab in its properties dialog box.\n\n(https://4sorcero.s3.amazonaws.com/byteback/core_2/fig_core_2_47.png)\nViewing permissions for a folder object. (Screenshot used with permission from Microsoft.)\n\nTo configure permissions, you first select the account to which the permissions apply. You can then set the appropriate permission level. In simple terms, the permissions. available are as follows:\n\n(https://4sorcero.s3.amazonaws.com/byteback/core_2/table_core_2_48.png)\n\nFull control: Do anything with the object, including change its permissions and owner.\n\nModify: Do most things with an object but not to change its permissions or owner.\n\nRead/list/execute: View the contents of a file or folder or start a program.\n\nWrite: Read a file and change it, or create a file within a folder, but not to delete it.\ntag:C2 L1 TC

FOLDER OPTIONS\n\n‘The Folder Options applet in Control Panel (or the Tools menu in Explorer or Options button in File Explorer) governs how Explorer shows folders and files. On the General tab, you can set options for the layout of Explorer windows.\n\n(https://4sorcero.s3.amazonaws.com/byteback/core_2/fig_core_2_48.png)\nFolder Options dialog box—General tab in Windows 7. (Screenshot used with permission from Microsoft.)\n\nOn the View tab, you can configure a number of settings for how folders and files are shown.\n\n(https://4sorcero.s3.amazonaws.com/byteback/core_2/fig_core_2_49.png)\nFolder Options dialog box—View tab in Windows 7. (Screenshot used with permission from Microsoft.)\n\nYou should pay particular attention to the following settings:\n• Hide extensions for known file types—Windows files are identified by a three- or four-character extension following the final period in the file name. The file extension determines which software application is used to open, edit, or print the file by default. Overtyping the file extension (when renaming a file) can make it difficult to open, so extensions are normally hidden from view.\n\n• Hidden files and folders—a file or folder can be marked as "Hidden" through its file attributes. Files marked as hidden are not shown by default but can be revealed by setting the Show hidden files, folders, and drives option. Note that this will not show "system" files, unless the following option is also disabled.\n\n• Hide protected operating system files—this configures "system" files as hidden. It is worth noting that in Windows, File/Resource Protection prevents users (even administrative users) from deleting these files anyway.\n\nYou can configure file search behavior on the Search tab. Search is also governed by how the Indexing Options applet is configured. This allows you to define indexed locations and rebuild the index. A corrupted index is a common cause of search problems.\n\nIn Windows 10, you can use the View menu ribbon to toggle hidden items and file extensions without going through the Folder Options dialog box.\n\n(https://4sorcero.s3.amazonaws.com/byteback/core_2/fig_core_2_50.png)\nSetting view options in the Windows 10 version of File Explorer.

DIRECTORY NAVIGATION AT THE COMMAND PROMPT\n\nEven under a GUI-operated OS such as Windows, it is important for a PC technician to be able to complete file management and configuration operations using the ‘command prompt. Some actions can be completed more quickly using commands; some commands can only be issued from a command-line; and sometimes the GUI may not be available.\n\nDIRECTORIES AND THE COMMAND PROMPT\nIf the root directory of the C: drive is selected, the command prompt will display C:\> The greater than sign (>) at the end of the prompt separates the prompt information from your input. if you change from the current directory (in this example, the root directory) to a first-level directory called "Windows," the prompt would become C: \Windows>.\n\nChanging to a second-level directory called "System32" would change the prompt to C: \Windows\system32\>.\n\nA backslash (\ is used to separate each directory level.\n\nNote: While Windows uses the backslash to delimit directories, if you type a path using forward slashes in Explorer or at the command prompt, it will stil be interpreted correctly. The Linux file system uses forward slashes.\n\nTHE DEFAULT DRIVE\nEach drive is assigned its own drive letter. When using the command prompt from Windows, the default path will usually be %HomePath% (for example, C:\Users\David). If the command prompt is open using Run as administrator, the default path will be C: \Windows\system32.\n\nTo change the working drive, just enter the drive letter followed by a colon and press Enter. For example, E: changes to the "€” drive. The prompt will change to E:\> indicating that the default drive is now drive E.\n\nNote: If you try to switch to a removable drive when the not in the drive, it will generate an error.\n\n(https://4sorcero.s3.amazonaws.com/byteback/core_2/fig_core_2_51a.png)\nChanging the default drive and dealing with a missing drive. (Screenshot used with permission from Microsoft.)\ntag:C2 L1 TC

CHANGING THE CURRENT DIRECTORY (CD)\n\nTo find a particular file, it is often necessary to move around the directory structure The cd (chdir) command is used to change the current directory. You can change to any directory by entering the full path, such as cd c:\ysers\david\n\nThere are a number of shortcuts, however. ent directory is "C:\Users\David" and you want to change to "C:\Users\D enter:cd documents\n\nIf the current directory is "C:\Users\David\Documents" and you want to move up to the parent directory, enter: cd.\n\nIf the current directory is "C:\Users\David" and you want to change to the root directory of the drive, enter: cd \\n\n(https://4sorcero.s3.amazonaws.com/byteback/core_2/fig_core_2_51b.png)\nNavigating directories with the cd command. (Screenshot used with permission from Microsoft.)\n\nIf the current directory is "C:\Users" and you want to change to "C:\Windows," enter: cd\windows\n\nIt is not possible to move across from one directory to another at the same level. To reach "C:\Windows" from "C:\Users," the command has to return to the root directory and then select the chosen branch.\n\nCommands such as cd\ or cd.. do not require a space. A common error is to use cd\Directory when cd Directory is required. To move further down the directory structure, use a space. The command cd\Directory sends the prompt back to the root directory from where it would then attempt to move into "Directory."\n\nLISTING FILES AND DIRECTORIES (DIR)\nUse the dir command to list the files and subdirectories from either the current drive and directory or from a specified drive and directory.\n\n(https://4sorcero.s3.amazonaws.com/byteback/core_2/fig_core_2_52.png)\ndir command. (Screenshot used with permission from Microsoft.)\nA subdirectory will be listed with <DIR> next to it in normal view or with square brackets [Windows] around the name if dir/w is used to list in wide view. To view all files and directories within the current directory, enter: dir\n\nTo view the files and directories in the root directory of the "A:" drive when your current drive is "C:" enter: dir A:\\n\nThe \ following the A: is important. Typing just dir A:  or dir C: would list the files present in the current directory for that drive (the last one used). To view files in a specific directory on drive A, you must type the full path; for example, dir A: \backups\n\nIf the current directory has more than one screen of files and directories, type:\n•  dir /w (lists files using wide format with no file details).\n•  dir /p (lists files one screen at a time).\n•  dir /w/p (both of the above).\n\nYou can present files in a particular order using the /o :x switch, where x could be n to list by name, s to list by size, e to list by extension, or d to list by date. The date field can be set by the /t :x switch, where x is c for created on, a for last access, or w for last modified.\n\nAnother useful switch is /a : x, which displays files with the attribute indicated by x (r for Read-only, h for hidden, s for system, and a for archive).\ntag:C2 L1 TC

WILDCARDS (QUESTION MARK [?] AND ASTERISK [*])\n\nA wildcard character allows you to use unspecified characters with the command. A question mark (?) means a single unspecified character. For example, the command dir ????????.1og will display all log files with 8 characters in the file name.\n\nThe asterisk can be used to indicate a string of unspecified characters. The following examples show possible ways to use the asterisk with the dir command:\n\n• dir *.* —displays all files and directories in the current directory.\n• dir *.doc —displays all files with the DOC extension in the current directory.\n• dir let*.doc —same as the previous example, but only shows files with LET as the first characters of the name.\n• dir let*.doc /s —same as the previous example, but also searches subdirectories.\n* dir *. —displays all files without an extension. This is often used to view directories.\ntag:C2 L1 TC

FILE MANAGEMENT AT THE COMMAND PROMPT\n\nThe move and copy commands provide the ability to transfer files from one disk or directory to another from a command prompt. Both commands use a three-part syntax: COMMAND Source Destination where Sources the drive name, path, and name of the files to be moved/copied and Destination is the drive name and path of the new location. When using copy, you can enter a different filename to create a duplicate in the same directory. For example, you want to copy all the files from the "C:\Documents" directory to the "C:\Backup" directory. You also want to move any files with a "txt" extension from the "C:\Backup" directory to the "C:\BackupArchive" directory.\n\nCOPYING DIRECTORY STRUCTURES\nxcopy is a utility that allows you to copy the contents of more than one directory at a time and retain the directory structure. The syntax for xcopy is as follows: xcopy Source [Destination] [Switches].\n\nYou can use switches to include or exclude files and folders by their attributes. Check the command help for additional switches and syntax.\n\nrobocopy\n\nrobocopy (or “robust copy") is another file copy utility. It was previously available in the Windows Resource Kit but is now included as a native command in Windows. Microsoft now recommends using robocopy rather than xcopy.\n\nrobocopy is designed to work better with long file names and NTFS attributes. Check the command help for additional switches and syntax.\n\nNote: Despite the name, you can also use robocop y to move files (/mo v switch).\n\nRENAMING A FILE\nTo change a file name, use the ren command. The syntax of this command is: ren OldName NewName. For example, to rename the ReadMe.txt file to ReadNow.doc, use the following command: ren readme.txt readnow.doc\n\nTo rename multiple files, wildcard characters may be used. For example, ren #.txt *.doc will rename all files with an extension of TXT to DOC.\n\nNote: Changing a file extension is not usually a good idea, as the file will no longer be associated with the application used to open it.\n\nDELETING A FILE\nTo remove a file from a directory or a disk, use the de1 command. The erase command has identical usage. The following switches are available with the del command:\n\n(https://4sorcero.s3.amazonaws.com/byteback/core_2/table_core_2_54.png)\n\n/p Prompt to delete for each file.\n/t Suppress prompt for read-only files.\n/q Suppress prompt on wildcard delete.\n/s Delete files from subdirectories.\n/a: Delete files with particular attributes (for example, /a: r) or without particular attributes (for example, /a: -r).\n\nCREATING A DIRECTORY\nTo create a directory, use the md or mkdir command. For example, to create a directory called "Data" in the current directory, type md Data. To create a directory called "Docs" in a directory called "Data" on the A drive, when the current path is "C:\" type md A:\Data\Docs\n\nREMOVING A DIRECTORY\nTo delete an empty directory, type rd. Directory. If the directory is not empty, you can remove files and subdirectories from it using the rd /s command. You can also use the /q switch to suppress confirmation messages (quiet mode).\ntag:C2 L1 TC

Activity 1-4\nDiscussing File Management in Windows\n\nSCENARIO\nAnswer the following questions to check your understanding of the topic.\n\nQuestion 1. Which is or are the main location(s) for system files in Windows?\n\nQuestion 2. True or false? In Windows 7, libraries cannot contain network folders.\n\nQuestion 3. You receive a call from a user trying to save a file and receiving an "Access Denied" error.

Topic D\nManage Disks in Windows\n\nEXAM OBJECTIVES COVERED\n1002-1.3 Summarize general OS installation considerations and upgrade methods.\n1002-1.4 Given a scenario, use appropriate Microsoft command line tools.\n1002-1.5 Given a scenario, use Microsoft operating system features and tools.\n\nMuch of the time the default options for Windows Setup will take care of preparing the computer's fixed disk storage for use. Equally, there will be plenty of occasions in your career when you need to configure custom partitions, use different file systems, or configure software RAID. This topic will teach you how to perform such disk ‘management tasks using the console and command-line tools.\ntag:C2 L1 TD

DISK PARTITIONS\n\nA mass storage device or fixed disk, such as Hard Disk Drive (HDD) or Solid State Drive (SSD), requires partitioning and formatting before it can be used. The Disk Management snap-in is used to configure partitions, or you can use diskpart from a command line. For a new installation, you can configure and format partitions using the Setup program.\n\nPARTITIONING\nPartitioning the physical disk is the act of dividing it into logically separate storage areas, often referred to as “drives.” You must create at least one partition on a fixed disk before performing a high-level format to create a file system. Typically, this is done through Windows Setup when building a new PC or through Disk Management when adding an extra disk.\n\nInformation about partitions is stored in a Master Boot Record (MBR), which is located in the first 512 byte sector on the disk. The GUI (Globally Unique Identifier) Partition Table (GPT) provides a more up-to-date scheme to address some of the limitations of MBR.\n\nUnder Windows, disks can be configured as either basic or dynamic. Configuring dynamic disks enables the use of multiple disks for single "volumes" and is discussed later.\n\nNote: Volume (or drive) is @ term used at the OS level to refer to a contiguous storage area formatted with a single fie system. This could mean a partition on a hard disk, @ CD-ROM, a floppy disk, or a RAID virtual disk spanning multiple hard disks. The term partition is more specific than volume—it refers to an area on a hard disk or SSD.\n\nMBR-STYLE PARTITIONING\nWith basic storage and MBR-style partitions, a given physical disk can contain up to four primary partitions, any one of which can be marked as active, and therefore made bootable. This allows for four different "drives" on the same physical disk and for multiple operating systems (a multiboot system). You might also use partitions to create discrete areas for user data file storage, storing log files, or hosting databases. Each drive can be formatted with a different file system.\n\nEach primary partition contains a boot sector, or Partition Boot Record (PBR/Volume Boot Record (VBR), at the start of the partition. When a partition is marked as active, its boot sector is populated with a record that points to the Windows boot loader (typically C\Windows\System32\winload.exe). This active partition is also referred to as the system partition or system reserved partition.\n\nThe drive containing the operating system files (the system root) is referred to as the boot partition. This can be on a logical drive in an extended partition and does not have to be the same as the system drive. The typical installation options for Windows create a "hidden" system reserved partition (with no drive letter) and label the boot partition as drive C:,\n\nIf for some reason four drives are insufficient, then three primary partitions can be created and the remaining disk space allocated to an extended partition, which itself can be divided into as many logical drives as needed. Extended partitions do not have boot sectors and cannot be made active.\n\nGPT-STYLE PARTITIONING\nA disk with no existing partitions on it can be converted to use the GPT-style partition format. All currently supported versions of Windows have read/write support for GPT disks. GPT is required on the boot device for 64-bit versions of Windows when installed, toa computer with Unified Extensible Firmware Interface (UEFI) firmware. A computer with older Basic Input/Output System (BIOS) firmware will normally have to use MBR.\n\nOne of the features of GPT is support for more than four primary partitions. Windows allows up to 128 partitions with GPT. GPT also supports larger partitions (2 TB+) and a backup copy of the partition entries. A GPT-style disk includes a Protective MBR for compatibility with systems that do not recognize GPT.\n\nNote: For Windows 10 on a UEFI PC, Microsoft's recommendation is to create a number of additional hidden utility partitions, including one for the Recovery Environment (RE) You can read more about Microsoft's recommended partition scheme at docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/manufacture/desktop/configure-uefigpt-based-hard-drive-partitions.\ntag:C2 L1 TD

FILE SYSTEMS\n\nHigh-level formatting prepares a partition for use with an operating system. The format process creates a file system on the disk partition. Each partition can be formatted using a different file system. Drives for use with Windows should generally be formatted using NTFS, which is more efficient and supports advanced features such as permissions, encryption, and quota management. The older FAT/FAT32 system can be used for compatibility with legacy versions of Windows or other operating systems in a dual-boot environment.\n\nCLUSTERS\nThe smallest unit of storage on a fixed disk has traditionally been the 512 byte sector. Afile system is not restricted to using a single sector as the basic unit of storage, however. The file system can group sectors into clusters (or Allocation Units) of 2, 4, or 8 sectors. Smaller clusters make more efficient use of the disk capacity, but using larger clusters can improve file Input/Output (1/0) performance, especially when working with large files.\n\nAs fixed disk sizes have increased, some disk models now use Advanced Format, with 4 kilobyte (4K) sector sizes. If supported by the OS and PC firmware, these can be used in native mode; if not, the drive controller will usually present the disk in 512 emulated. (512e) mode.\n\nNEW TECHNOLOGY FILE SYSTEM (NTFS)\nThe New Technology File System (NTFS) is a proprietary file system developed  exclusively for use with Windows. It provides a 64-bit addressing scheme, allowing for  very large volumes and file sizes. In theory, the maximum volume size is 16 Exabytes, but actual implementations of NTFS are limited to between 137 GB and 256 Terabytes, depending on the version of Windows and the allocation unit size. The key NTFS features are:\n\n• Recovery—NTFS utilizes sector sparing and transaction tracking to provide reliable data transfer. When data is written to an NTFS volume, it is re-read and verified. In the event of a problem, the sector concerned is marked as bad and the data relocated, Transaction tracking logs all disk and file system activity, making recovery after power outage a faster and more reliable process.\n\n• Security—NTFS has many security features. These include file permissions and ownership, file access audit trails, quota management, and Encrypting File System (EFS).\n\n• POSIX Compliance—in efforts to support the UNIX/Linux community, Microsoft engineered the NTFS file system to support case sensitive naming, hard links, and other key features required by UNIX/Linux applications. Although the file system is case-sensitive capable and preserves case, Windows does not insist upon case sensitive naming.\n\n• Compression—NTFS allows file- or folder-level compression.\n\n• Indexing—the Indexing Service creates a catalog of file and folder locations and properties, speeding up searches.\n\n• Dynamic Disks—this is a disk management feature allowing space on multiple physical disks to be combined into volumes.\n\nNote: Windows Home/Core editions do not support dynamic disks or encryption. There is a cipher.exe tool to allow the user to decrypt files but no option to perform encryption of files or folders.\n\nThe only significant drawback of NTFS is that it is not fully supported by operating systems other than Windows. macOS can read NTFS drives but cannot write to them. Linux distributions and utilities may be able to support NTFS to some degree.\n\nFAT\nThe FAT file system is named for its method of organization—the File Allocation Table. This 16-bit table of values provides links from one allocation unit to another.\n\nNote: FAT was originally designed as a 12-bit file system for floppy disks (FAT12). The 16-bit version (FAT16) was developed for the first PCs to ship with hard drives.\n\nFAT16\nAFATI6 system does not support the recovery or security features of NTFS. The maximum volume size is either 2 GB or 4 GB, depending on the version in use, and the maximum file size is the volume size minus 1 byte. Its only significant feature is that it is compatible with all Microsoft operating systems plus macOS and Linux, and therefore ideal in a multiboot environment or for removable media that must be shared between different operating systems.\n\nFAT32\nFAT32 does not differ greatly from FAT16. Because it has a 32-bit allocation table, it supports larger volumes than FAT16—nominally up to 2 TB, though the Windows Setup program will only format partitions up to 32 GB in size. It suffers from the same reliability and security issues as FAT16. The maximum file size is 4 GB minus 1 byte.\n\nAgain, it is ideal in a multiboot or removable storage environment with Windows 9x, macOS, or Linux, but it is not supported by DOS.\n\nEXFAT\nAnother option is a 64-bit version of FAT called exFAT. exFAT is designed for use with removable hard drives and flash media. Like NTFS, exFAT supports large volumes (128 petabytes) and file sizes (16 exabytes). Its real use is not for massive drives, however, but for better performance on moderate size volumes (up to 1 TB) than NTFS. There is also support for access permissions but not compression or encryption.\n\nCDFS\nThe CD File System (CDFS or ISO 9660) is a legacy file system used for CD optical disc media (CD-ROM and CD-R). CDFS supports two main data writing modes: mode 1 has better error correction, whereas mode 2 allows more data to be written to the disc. Joliet is an extension to CDFS that enables long file name support and Unicode characters in file names.\n\nUDF (ISO 13346)\nThe Universal Disk Format (UDF or ISO 13346) is an updated file system for optical media with support for multisession writing. It is the standard used by Windows, where it is referred to as Live File System, for CD and DVD recordable and rewritable discs.\n\nThere are several different versions of UDF, with 2.01 being the default in Windows. Blu-ray reading and writing requires version 2.5 and third-party software.\ntag:C2 L1 TD

THE WINDOWS DISK MANAGEMENT CONSOLE\n\nWindows provides the Disk Management console to format disks and manage partitions. The utility displays a summary of any fixed and removable drives attached to the system. The top pane lists drives; the bottom pane lists disks, with information about the partitions created on each disk and any unpartitioned space.\n\n(https://4sorcero.s3.amazonaws.com/byteback/core_2/fig_core_2_60.png)\nDisk Management utility in Windows 8.1. (Screenshot used with permission from Microsoft.)\n\nTo open the tool, right-click Computer/This PC and select Manage then select the Disk Management icon under Storage. You can also use the WinX menu (right-click Start).\n\nINITIALIZING DISKS\nIf you add a hard disk to the system, you will be prompted to initialize it when you start Disk Management. You can choose whether to use the MBR or GPT partition style for the new disk.\n\n(https://4sorcero.s3.amazonaws.com/byteback/core_2/fig_core_2_61a.png)\nInitializing newly detected disks—note the option to choose between MBR and GPT. (Screenshot used with permission from Microsoft.)\n\nWhen a disk has been initialized, you can create partitions on it. You can also create a new partition on an existing disk if there is unpartitioned space on the disk.\n\nADDING DRIVES AND ASSIGNING DRIVE LETTERS\nTo create a new partition, right-click an area of unallocated space and select New Simple Volume. Complete the wizard to select:\n• Amount of disk space to use (in megabytes—recall that 1024 MB is 1 GB).\n\n(https://4sorcero.s3.amazonaws.com/byteback/core_2/fig_core_2_61b.png)\nNew Simple Volume Wizard—configuring volume size. (Screenshot used with permission from Microsoft.)\n\n• Assign a drive letter or a mount point. You can also choose not to assign a drive or mount point, in which case the volume will be inaccessible via Explorer.\n\n(https://4sorcero.s3.amazonaws.com/byteback/core_2/fig_core_2_62a.png)\nNew Simple Volume Wizard—configuring access path. (Screenshot used with permission from Microsoft.)\n\nFORMATTING THE DRIVE\nTo complete the wizard, you must select a file system to use to format the new partition. You can make the following choices:\n\n• NTFS or FAT for the file system.\n\n• Allocation unit size—default settings are usually best (selects a size based on the volume size). As a rule of thumb, a small allocation unit size is efficient if the disk stores mainly small files or vice versa, but a typical desktop machine will make equal use of small and large files.\n\n• Volume label—shown in Explorer along with the drive letter.\n\n• Quick format—a full format checks the disk for bad sectors; selecting the quick format option skips this check.\n\n(https://4sorcero.s3.amazonaws.com/byteback/core_2/fig_core_2_62b.png)\nNew Simple Volume Wizard—formatting the volume. (Screenshot used with permission from Microsoft)\n\nNote: Both types of format remove references to existing files in the volume boot record but the actual sectors are not "scrubbed" or zeroed. Existing files will be overwritten as new files are added to the volume, but in principle data can be recovered from a formatted disk (using third-party tools). A secure format utility prevents this by overwriting each sector with a zero value, sometimes using multiple passes.\n\nHaving set up the disk structure, if you want to change it in the future, then partitions can be managed using the shortcut menu, which contains options to mark a partition a active, re-format or delete it, or change its drive letter. You can also access the volume properties sheet, which contains options for the disk performance tools and access permissions and quota management (on NTFS volumes).\n\nNote: You cannot format or delete system or boot partitions.\n\nSPLITTING AND EXTENDING PARTITIONS\nYou can shrink or extend simple volumes formatted with NTFS and unformatted volumes. Shrinking a volume then creating a new volume on the same disk allows you to “split” the original volume. Shrinking a volume is contingent on the files stored in the volume. If there is an unmovable file, the volume cannot be shrunk past it. Extending a volume is contingent on the amount of space left on the physical disk.\n\n(https://4sorcero.s3.amazonaws.com/byteback/core_2/fig_core_2_63.png)\nShrinking a simple volume. (Screenshot used with permission from Microsoft.)\n\nNote: Before trying to shrink a volume, disable the hibernation file and pagefile, then clean up and defragment the disk. It may be worth trying a third-party defragmentation utility to try to move files that Windows’ builtin Defragmenter cannot.\ntag:C2 L1 TD

DISK ARRAYS\n\nDynamic storage allows the creation of volumes spanning multiple disks (an array). Dynamic disks can only be read by the Professional/Enterprise (and Ultimate) editions of Windows.\n\nNote: Windows Home/Core editions do not support dynamic disks at all, so if you were to configure dynamic disks under Windows 7 Professional, then move the disks to a computer running Windows 7 Home Premium, the volumes would not be readable. Also, the option to convert from basic to dynamic disks is disabled on laptops.\n\nOnly fixed disks can be used. A fixed disk is one installed within the computer and connected by the SATA or NVMe (PCI Express) bus. Disks connected via USB, Thunderbolt, or eSATA cannot be converted to dynamic.\n\nDYNAMIC VOLUME TYPES\nDynamic volumes can be in the following configurations:\n\n• Simple—occupies space on a single disk. There is little difference in practice between this and a basic volume.\n\n• Spanned—a volume using space on two or more disks. This arrangement is also referred to as JBOD (Just a Bunch Of Disks).\n\n• Striped—a volume using space on two or more disks configured using RAID 0 to improve performance. Basically data is written across all disks, whereas spanned just uses up space on the volume using the standard file access pattern.\n\n(https://4sorcero.s3.amazonaws.com/byteback/core_2/fig_core_2_64.png)\nCreating a mirrored volume dynamic disk array. (Screenshot used with permission from Microsoft.)\n\n• Mirrored—a volume where one disk stores a copy (mirror) of the other disk. This provides redundancy (RAID 1). Redundancy means that one of the disks can fail, but the volume will still be accessible.\n\n• RAID 5—a volume where data is spread across three or more disks. The system writes parity information alongside the data. If one of the disks is damaged, the remaining data can be combined with the remaining parity information to keep the volume functioning. RAID 5 is only supported under Windows 8/10.\n\nMANAGING VOLUMES\nWhen a mirrored volume has been set up, you have two options for converting the mirror set back to a simple volume:\n\n• Breaking the mirror leaves the data in the volumes on both disks intact. You would\nalso use this option to replace one of the disks in the mirror set (install the physical\ndisk then use the Add Mirror command on the existing volume).\n\n(https://4sorcero.s3.amazonaws.com/byteback/core_2/fig_core_2_65.png)\nWhen a physical disk underlying a mirrored volume fail, you can install another disk and add it to the mirror—a resynching process will start to copy data from the first disk to the second. (Screenshot used with permission from Microsoft.)\n\n• Removing a mirror deletes the volume (and any files it contains) from that disk, leaving the volume on the other disk asa simple volume.\n\nNote: Spanned and striped volumes offer flexibility, but if any of the disks in the array fail, all data on the volume will be lost. Only mirroring and RAID 5 provide redundancy.\n\nA dynamic disk can be converted back to basic, but the volumes (and any data on them) must be deleted first. As with basic partitions, volumes must be formatted (NTFS. or FAT/FAT32) before they can be available to the OS.\ntag:C2 L1 TD

DRIVE STATUS INDICATORS\n\nEach disk and drive displays status indicators in the Disk Management program. Disks can have the following status indicators:\n\n• Online—The disk is OK.\n\n• Not Initialized—when you add a new unpartitioned disk, a wizard runs, prompting you to initialize, partition, and format the disk. If you cancel the wizard, the disk will appear as Not initialized. Right-click to start the wizard again.\n\n• Unreadable—The disk is damaged. This message can be transitory so try right- clicking the Disk Management tool and selecting Rescan Disks. If the disk is still shown as unreadable, you would have to use third-party tools to try to recover data from it.\n\n• Foreign—if you configure a disk as dynamic on one computer, then install the disk in another computer, it will be marked as foreign. Right-click the disk and select Import Foreign Disk to make it accessible to the system.\n\n• Offline/Missing—a disk configured as dynamic cannot be read. This could be a transitory error but is more likely to indicate that the drive or I/O to the drive is damaged, a cable is unplugged, the disk has been switched off, and so on. There are two options:\no If the disk can be restored, use the Reactivate Disk option to add it back to the\no If the disk cannot be restored, use the Remove Disk option.\n\n(https://4sorcero.s3.amazonaws.com/byteback/core_2/fig_core_2_66.png)\nOne of the disks underlying the mirrored volume is missing and consequently the volume is marked as failed. (Screenshot used with permission from Microsoft.)\n\nVolumes (or partitions) can have the following status indicators:\n\n• Healthy—The volume is formatted and ready to read and write data. Healthy (System) indicates that the volume contains the boot loader, whereas Healthy (Active) represents the system volume used to boot. Healthy (Boot) represents a volume containing an OS, whereas Healthy (Page File) shows one storing a pagefile. A drive may also display as Healthy (At Risk), which means that a number of I/O errors are occurring—a good sign that the disk or controller is failing.\n\n• Failed/Unknown—This either indicates a damaged disk (basic) or a dynamic volume where the supporting disk drives are not available. You need to check the status of the devices (if cabling and power are OK, the disk[s] or controller may have been damaged). A volume listed as "Unknown" has an unreadable boot sector.\n\n• Failed Redundancy—A RAID volume that is still working but that is no longer fault tolerant. You should identify the failed disk and replace it.\n\n• Regenerating—When a disk is brought back into a damaged RAID 5 volume, the controller begins regenerating parity information for the volume. It should be accessible during this period, but performance will be worse.\n\n• Resynching—Occurs when a disk is restored to a mirrored volume.\n\n• Formatting—A user-initiated format is in progress. Wait for the format to complete before trying to access the volume.\ntag:C2 L1 TD

STORAGE SPACES\n\nAs mentioned previously, dynamic disks can only be configured on local fixed disks. Windows 8/10 comes with a Storage Spaces feature, allowing arrays to be configured across all kinds of storage devices, including USB-connected disks. Also, Storage Spaces is available in the "core" and home editions, unlike dynamic disks.\n\nTo configure a storage space, first select the drives that you want to add to the pool. You can then configure what type of redundancy to configure (mirrored or parity), format the volume, and assign a drive letter.\n\n(https://4sorcero.s3.amazonaws.com/byteback/core_2/fig_core_2_67a.png)\nAdding drives to a storage space pool.

(Screenshot used with permission from Microsoft.)\ntag:C2 L1 TD

MOUNT POINTS AND DISK IMAGES\n\nA mount point means that rather than allocating a drive letter to a volume, it is accessed from a designated folder in the file system. The host file system must be NTFS but the volume mounted can be formatted with any type of file system. For example, you might partition and format a removable hard disk then mount it as a DATA volume within a user’s Documents folder. To assign a volume to a mount point, first create a folder at the point in the file system you want to mount the drive. This folder must be empty. Next, either run the New Partition/Volume Wizard or unassign the drive letter from an existing partition and mount it (use the Change Drive Letter and Paths shortcut menu to do this).\n \n(https://4sorcero.s3.amazonaws.com/byteback/core_2/fig_core_2_68.png)\nDATA volume mounted within the Documents library—notice that no “DATA” drive appears under any of the drive letters. (Screenshot used with permission from Microsoft)\n\nDisk images are used with virtualization software to store data written to a virtual machine's hard drive. Windows supports mounting Windows Hyper-V disk image files (VHD and VHDX) within the local file system (right-click Disk Management and select Attach VHD). An ISO image is a file copy of a CD or DVD. Windows 7 cannot mount ISO images natively, though there is third-party software available to do this, but Windows 8/10 can. You can also burn an image to a physical disc through Explorer.\ntag:C2 L1 TD

DISK AND VOLUME MANAGEMENT AT THE COMMAND PROMPT\n\nThe Disk Management snap-in is easy to use but there are some circumstances where you may need to manage volumes at a command prompt.\n\nTHE diskpart COMMAND\nThe diskpart command is the command interface underlying the Disk Management tool. It can be run at an elevated Windows command prompt or Windows Recovery Environment/Pre-installation Environment.\n\nNote: The Disk Management tool prevents you from completing certain destructive actions, such as deleting the system or boot volume. diskpart is not restricted in this way, so use it with care.\n\nThere are too many options in diskpart to cover here, but the basic process of inspecting disks and partitions is as follows:\n\n1. Run the diskpart utility then enter select disk 0 atthe prompt (or the number of the disk you want to check),\n\n2. Type detail disk and then press Enter to display configuration information for the disk. The utility should report that the partitions (or volumes) are healthy. If diskpart reports that the hard disk has no partitions, the partition table may have become corrupted by a virus. You may be able to resolve this by partitioning and formatting the drive.\n\n3. Enter either select partition O or select volume 0 at the prompt (or the number of the partition or volume you want to check).\n\n4, Enter either detail partition or detail volume to view information about the object. You can now use commands such as gn (change the drive letter), delete (destroy the volume), or extend.\n\n5. Enter exit to quit diskpart.\n \n(https://4sorcero.s3.amazonaws.com/byteback/core_2/fig_core_2_69.png)\nThe diskpart program showing a hard disk partition structure, (Screenshot used with permission from Microsoft.)\n\nTHE format COMMAND\nThe format command formats (or re-formats) the drive using the specified file system, This process deletes any data existing on the drive.\n\nNote: You can convert a FAT drive to NTFS without losing data using the command convert volume /fs:nt £5. tis not possible to convert back from NTFS. A full backup of the disk should always be taken before converting.\n\nThe basic command is format volume, where volume is a drive letter or volume name. The main switches are as follows.\n\n(https://4sorcero.s3.amazonaws.com/byteback/core_2/table_core_2_69.png)\n(https://4sorcero.s3.amazonaws.com/byteback/core_2/table_core_2_70.png)\n\n/fs: Specify the file system (such as NTFS, exFAT, FAT32, or FAT).\n\n/v: Enter a label for the volume. If you do not include this switch, you are prompted for a label when format is complete.\n\n/g Perform a quick format (does not scan for bad sectors).\n\n/a: Specify the size of allocation units (512, 1024, 2048, 4096, 8192, 16K, 32K, 64K). If omitted, the default size depends on the size of the volume.\n\n/x Force the volume to dismount. This will cause fie errors for users with files open on the volume.\n\n/c Enable file compression if using NTFS. It's not usually a good idea to enable compression on the drive root, especially if the drive contains system files. Use folder properties to enable compression on a case-by-case basis.\ntag:C2 L1 TD

Browse system objects and folders to understand the file system hierarchy in Windows 7.\n\na) Open the Hyper-V Manager window. in the Virtual Machines panel, right-click PC2 and select Start. Double-click the VM to open the connection window.\n\nb) Press Ctrl+Alt+End to show the sign-on screen. Select Switch User and then select, Other User to use a different account to the one shown initially. In the User name box, type .VAdmin. Type PaSSwOrd in the Password box, and then press Enter.\n\nc) On the taskbar, select the Windows Explorer icon.\n\nd) In the left pane, select the Computer icon. The Computer object contains the drives mapped to drive letters. In this case, you can see the boot disk (Local disk :) and removable drives such as the DVD drive (D:)\n\ne) In the left pane, select the arrow to expand Computer and then select Local disk (C:) to show the folders off the root of the C: drive in the main pane.\n\nMost of the folders shown here are created during the installation of Windows.\n• Program Files/Program Files (x86)—contains the files installed by software applications.\n• Users—contains subfolders for each user account, which store user profile configuration files and user-generated files.\n• Windows—the files used by Windows itself.\n\nf) In the left pane, select the Libraries icon.\n\nUser content is designed to be accessed via libraries. A library is a virtual storage location that can be configured to show the contents of designated folders. The default libraries show the contents of the user's personal profile and the public profile for Documents, Music, Pictures, and Videos.\n\nNote: Note that the Libraries feature is stil available in Windows 8/10 but is hidden by default. Microsoft now emphasizes the use of OneDrive to store\ndocuments, rather than the local file system.\n\ng) From the Start Menu, select the Admin user name.\n\nThis opens another Explorer window showing the full contents of the profile. As you can see, there is the folder for the Desktop, as well as ones for Favorites, Saved Searches, Downloads, and so on. Each user can create new folders and files within their own folders. Creating folders and files outside this area may require administrator privileges.\n\nh) In Explorer, press Alt to show the menu bar and select Tools Folder options View. Under Advanced settings, select Show hidden files, folders, and drives, and uncheck Hide extensions for known file types and Hide protected operating system files.\n\ni) Select Yes to confirm, and then select OK to apply the changes.\n\nj) In the user folder, look at some of the system files and folders that have been revealed:\n\n• NTUSER contains registry settings related to the user account,\n\n• AppData contains settings and temporary files related to software applications.\n\nk) In the navigation pane, select Local Disk (C:).

(Screenshot used with permission from Microsoft)\n\nj) In the Settings for PC1 dialog box, select OK.\n\n3. Configure a simple partition on one of the new disks. Use NTFS formatting, the label LABFILES, and assign drive letter L\n\na) Start PC1 and sign on to the Admin account with the PagswOrd credential.\n\nb) Right-click Start and select Disk Management.\nA dialog box appears because new disks have been detected. If you look behind the dialog box, you should see that the new disks are marked Unknown.\n\nc) Select OK to initialize the disks using GPT partitioning.\nThe new disks are now marked Online.\n\nd) Right-lck the unallocated space on Disk 1 and select New Simple Volume.\nComplete the New Simple Volume wizard by selecting the following options. Select, Next.\n\ne) Onthe Specify Volume Size page, select Next to accept the default value and use all available space on the disk.\n\nf) Select Assign the following drive letter and then select L. Select Next.\n\n9) From the File system box, leave NTFSselected and verify that Perform a quick format is checked. In the Volume label box, type LABFILES\n\nh) Select Next then Finish.\nWhen formatting is complete, the partition is marked as Healthy.\n\ni) Leave the Disk Management console open.\n\n4, Browse the system objects and folders in Windows 10 to compare them to\nWindows 7. Observe folder permissions to distinguish the permissions set on a\nuser folder to those set on a system folder.\n\na) On the taskbar, select the File Explorer icon.\n\nb) Observe that the layout of objects in the navigation pane is different to Windows 7.\nThe computer object (This PC) contains the profile folders as well as local drives. The Libraries objectis replaced by OneDrive (though you can show Libraries too)\n\nc) Browse the Local Disk (C:) drive. Verify that the system folders are the same as Windows 7.\n\nd) Right-click Documents and select Properties. Select the Security tab. Observe that the Admin user plus SYSTEM and Administrators group accounts are listed. Each account has Full Control. Select Cancel.\n\ne) Right-click the Windows folder and select Properties. Select the Security tab. Observe that there are no individual user accounts listed. Most of the group account permissions are not shown (they are allocated special permissions). The Users group account can view the folder but cannot make changes. Select Cancel.\n\n5. Practice performing directory navigation at the command line.\n\na) Open a command prompt, then type Cd. . and press Enter.\nThis changes the prompt focus to the parent directory.\n\nb) Type cd\ and press Enter to go to the root directory of drive C:\n\nc) Enter dir to geta file and directory listing. Is everything displayed?\nHidden files are not shown.\n\nd) Enter dir /? to view help for the command, Which switches are required to display everything displayed?\ndir /a:hs\n\ne) Enter dir with the switches required to list hidden files.\n\n6. In this step, you will identify some of the differences between copy, xcopy, and robocopy. You need to copy the contents of the C:\LABFILES folder to a DATA folder on the L drive, The DATA folder does not currently exist.\n\na) Run the following command and note the errors:\ncopy C:\LABFILES\* L:\ DATA\\n\nb) Try the following command\ncopy C:\ LABFILES\* L:\ DATA\n\nc) Look at the last message in the output—does it seem odd? Browse the L drive in Explorer. You will see a DATA file with no extension. Open the Data file in Notepad, and verify that the contents of the copied files is shown in this file. Close Notepad and delete the DATA file.\n\nd) Now try the first command again but use XCOPY rather than COpy:\nxcopy C:\ LABFILES\* L:\ DATA\\n\nDoes it work?\n\nIt copies the files but not the subdirectories.\n\ne) Work out the XCOPY command to duplicate completely the contents of C:\LABFILES. to the L:\DATA folder. What is the command you need to use?\n\nxcopy C:\LABFILES\* L:\DATA\ /s /e /y\n\nf) Run the command to verify it works as you expect it to work,\n\ng) Use the tree L:\DATA command to obtain a directory listing of the folder DATA to\ncheck you have used XCOPY correctly.\n\nYou should see several subfolders, including some empty ones—if you have made a mistake, use the F d command to remove the DATA folder.\n\nBoth Copy and XCOPY are now deprecated in favor of F OOCOPY (robust copy)\n\n7. Work out the r obocopy command to move files smaller than 10 KB from the DATA folder to a SmallData folder on the L: drive.\n\n8. Work out the r bocopy command to recreate the directory structure of c: \LABFILES: within a DataLayout folder on the L: drive.\n\n9. In this step, you will explore options for configuring software RAID (Redundant Array of Independent Disks). Mirroring means that each file write is duplicated to two disks. If one disk fails, the volume will continue to work. The drawback is that only 50% of the disk space is available. As the next task, reconfigure the LABFILES Partition as a mirrored volume and mount it as LABFILES to the Public user folder.\n\na) Switch to the Disk Management console. Right-click Disk 1 and select Convert to Dynamic Disk. In the dialog box, check Disk 2 also and select OK In the Disks to Convert dialog box, select Convert. Confirm by selecting Yes.\n\nb) Right-click the LABFILES volume and select Add Mirror. In the dialog box, select Disk 2then select the Add Mirror button.\n\nc) Observe that when synching is complete, the volume is marked as Healthy.\nThe color-coding of the volume is different to that of the partitions on Disk 0 (the disk hosting the system and boot partitions). This color indicates that the volume is mirrored.\n\nd) Right-click the volume and select Change Drive Letter and Paths. Select the Add button, Select the Browse button.\n\ne) Expand C:→Users→Public then select the New Folder button. Type LABFILES and press Enter. Select OK to choose the folder. Select OK.\n\nf) Use File Explorer to browse the C:\Users\Pubblic folder. Note the icon for the ‘mounted volume. Open it to check that the files you copied survived the conversion.\n\n10. Observe the effect on the array of a disk “failure.” You can simulate this by disabling the disk device.\n\na) Right-click Start and select Device Manager.\n\nb) Expand Disk drives. Right-click the last Microsoft Virtual Disk iter in the list and\nselect Disable device. Confirm the prompt by selecting Yes, Select Yes to restart.\n\nc) Sign back on and open the Disk Management console again. Note the status messages.\nThe volume continues to function using the single device. ifthe other disk were to fail the volume would be lost. When a volume is in this state, make sure itis backed up and then try to restore the second disk and rebuild the mirror.\n\n11. Disk Management is the easiest way to perform disk configuration. However, you can also use command line tools. These tools should be used with care! In this step, explore the use of diskpart commands.\n\na) Open acommand prompt, then type di Skpar't and press Enter to start the disk utility. Select Yes at the UAC prompt.\n\nA new elevated command prompt window is opened,\n\nb) Type help and press Enter to view a list of commands.\n\n©) Enter the command list disk\n\nd) Enter the command select disk O followed by detail disk to display the configuration of the boot disk.\nThis contains three volumes. There is a system reserved volume with no drive letter formatted with FAT32 and a boot volume (holding the Windows files) with the drive letter C: assigned and formatted with NTFS. There is also a recovery tools partition. All volumes are of the partition type.\n\ne) Enter the command list partition followed by list volume.\n\nPartitions are configured on hard disks. A volume is often mapped to a single Partition but as you can see, there are other types of volume, including the optical drive and the mirrored volume you created earlier.\n\n(https://4sorcero.s3.amazonaws.com/byteback/core_2/fig_core_2_78.png)\nViewing information about volumes and partitions via diskpart. (Screenshot used with permission from Microsoft.)\n\nf) Enter the command select partition 2 followed by detail partition. Verify that the partition is marked system.\n\ng) Enter the command select volume 3 followed by detail volume to show information about the volume’s properties.\n\nh) Enter the command select disk 1 followed by detaiil disk to display the configuration of the remaining disk underpinning the LABFILES volume.\n\ni) Enter the command select volume O followed by detail volume to show information about the volume's properties.\n\nThis is the mirrored volume you configured.\n\nj) Enter assign letter=T to change the drive letter used for the mirrored volume. Run list volume to verify the changes.\n\nk) Type remove mount=C:\Users\Public\LABFILES and press Enter.\n\nl) Type exit then press Enter to quit the utility. Leave the other command prompt open.\n\nm) Observe the changes in Explorer\n\nC:\Users\Public\LABFILES is now an ordinary (empty) folder again but the data files are still present on drive T. You haven't deleted any information; just changed the way itis accessed.\n\n12. The format utility can be used to format any disk to use the FAT, FAT32, or NTFS file system, but the process deletes any existing data or directory structure on the drive, Re-format the mirrored volume with the FAT32 file system.\n\na) In the original command prompt. type format t: /fs:fat32 and press Enter. Observe the error.\n\nb) Close the command prompt, then select Start and type cmd, then press Ctrl#Shift+Enter. Confirm the UAC prompt by selecting Yes.\n\nc) Type format t: /fs:fat32 and press Enter.\n\nd) When prompted, confirm the volume label as LABFILES and then confirm the format by pressing y and then Enter.\n\ne) When formatting is complete, enter the volume label as TOOLS and close the command prompt window.\n\nf) Use Windows Explorer to verify that the files and folders you copied to the drive are 1no longer present.\n\n13. At the end of each activity, you need to close the VMs. You will always discard any\nchanges you made.\n\na) From the connection window, select Action—-Revert. If prompted, select the Revert button to confirm.\n\nb) Repeat to revert the PC2 VM.\n\nc) On the HOST, open File Explorer and browse to C:\COMPTIA-LABS\TEMP. Press Ctrl+A to select all the files and then press Delete. Confirm by selecting the Yes button.\n\nNote: When a VM is reverted, both changes to the disks and changes to settings are discarded.\ntag:C2 L1 TD A1-6

Topic E\nManage Devices in Windows\n\nEXAM OBJECTIVES COVERED\n1002-1.5 Given a scenario, use Microsoft operating system features and tools.\n1002-1.6 Given a scenario, use Microsoft Windows Control Panel utilities.\n\nIn this topic, you will use the Control Panel and Device Manager to install and configure PC peripheral devices and hardware settings under Windows.\ntag:C2 L1 TE

POWER OPTIONS\n\nPower management allows Windows to selectively reduce or turn off the power supplied to hardware components. This is important to avoid wasting energy when the computer is on but not being used and to maximize run-time when on battery power. Power management requires three compatible components:\n\n• Hardware—devices that support power management are often labeled Energy Star, after the US Environmental Protection Agency scheme. It is important for the CPU, motherboard, hard disks, and display screen to support power management.\n\n• Firmware—almost all chipsets support the power management standard Advanced Configuration and Power Interface (ACPI) but you may need to check that it has been enabled.\n\n• Operating System—current versions of Windows provide full ACPI compatibility.\n\nNote: Power management is more important on mobile devices but can be configured on desktops in much the same way.\n\nOne basic feature of ACPI is to support different power-saving modes. The computer can be configured to enter a power saving mode automatically; for example, if there is, no use of an input device for a set period. The user can also put the computer into a power-saving state rather than shutting down.\n\nThere are several levels of ACP! power mode, starting with SO (powered on) and ending with 5 (soft power off) and G3 (mechanically powered off). in-between these are different kinds of power-saving modes:\n\n• Standby/Suspend to RAM—cuts power to most devices (for example, the CPU, monitor, disk drives, and peripherals) but maintains power to the memory. This is also referred to as ACPI modes S1-S3.\n\n• Hibernate/Suspend to Disk—saves any data in memory (open files) to disk (as hiberfil.sys in the root of the boot volume) then turns the computer off. This is also referred to as ACPI mode S4.\n\nIn Windows, power management is implemented as the sleep and hybrid sleep modes\n\n• A laptop goes into the standby state as normal; if running on battery power, it will switch from standby to hibernate before the battery runs down.\n\n• A desktop creates a hibernation file then goes into the standby state. This is referred to as hybrid sleep mode. It can also be configured to switch to the full hibernation state after a defined period.\n\n• Windows 8 supports an alternative mode called Connected Standby or InstantGo, updated to Modern Standby in Windows 10. These utilize a device's ability to function in an SO low-power idle mode to maintain network connectivity without consuming too much energy. This option is only available with compatible hardware.\n\nNote: You can also set a specific device (such as the display or hard drive) to enter a power-saving state if it goes unused for a defined period (sleep timers). Note that some monitors still consume quite a lot of power in standby mode.\n\nCONFIGURING POWER OPTIONS\nThe Power Options Control Panel applet lets you configure power management settings via a system of power plans. These enable the user to switch between different sets of preconfigured options easily. Each power plan can be customized, or new plans can be defined and saved.\n\nAs well as configuring events for the power button or closing the lid of a laptop, the *shut down" option in Start Menu can be customized; so clicking the button could make the computer sleep while closing the lid could activate the hibernate routine. These settings can be defined for all plans (use the Choose what the power button does link in the bar on the left shown in the dialog box in the following figure) or on a per-plan basis (select the plan then configure advanced settings).\n \n(https://4sorcero.s3.amazonaws.com/byteback/core_2/fig_core_2_81.png)\nConfiguring power management in Windows 7. (Screenshot used with permission from Microsoft)\n\nAdvanced settings allow you to configure a very wide range of options, including CPU states, search and indexing behavior, display brightness, and so on.\n\nThere is no GUI option to disable hibernation (and consequently delete hiberfil.sys). This can be done via the command line(powerc fg -h off | on).\n\nIn Windows 10, you can still configure power plans via the Power Options applet but you can also set basic options quickly via the Power & sleep page in Windows Settings.\ntag:C2 L1 TE

DISPLAY AND SOUND DEVICES\n\nYou can configure the way Windows appears through Personalization settings in Control Panel/Settings. This allows you to select and customize themes, which set the appearance of the desktop environment, such as the wallpaper, screen saver, color scheme, and font size used.\n\nCONFIGURING THE DISPLAY RESOLUTION\nMost computers are now used with TFT display screens. These screens are really designed to be used only at their native resolution. Windows should detect this and configure itself appropriately. If you do need to adjust the resolution, right-click the desktop and select Screen resolution (Windows 7) or  Display settings (Windows 8/10). Alternatively, you can open the applets via Control Panel/Settings.\n\nCOLOR DEPTH AND REFRESH RATE\nYou might want to change the number of bits used to represent colors at some point; perhaps to make a legacy application work better. From the Screen resolution/Display settings applet, select Advanced display settings, and then on the Adapter tab for the monitor, select List All Modes. Choose an appropriate resolution and color depth mode. Windows 8/10 only supports 32-bit color.\n\nTFTs work at a pre-set refresh rate. If you have a CRT and need to tweak the rate, you can do this on the Monitor tab via Advanced display settings.\n\n(https://4sorcero.s3.amazonaws.com/byteback/core_2/fig_core_2_82.png)\nChecking the modes supported by a TFT monitor—various resolutions are available but all at 32-bit color and 60 Hertz refresh rate. (Screenshot used with permission from Microsoft.)\n\nSOUND SETTINGS\nUse the Sound applet in Control Panel/Settings to test microphone, headset, or speaker hardware and configure settings.\n\nIf you have multiple devices, you can choose the defaults on the Playback and Recording tabs and test levels for audio input and output.\n\nThe Communications tab lets you set an option to reduce other sounds if the device receives or places a telephone call. The Sounds tab lets you configure which noises Windows makes in response to actions and events, such as a calendar reminder or warning dialog box.\n\nUse the icon in the Notification Area to control the volume.\ntag:C2 L1 TE

HARDWARE DEVICE CONFIGURATION AND MANAGEMENT\n\nMost hardware devices use Plug-and-Play. This means that Windows automatically detects when a new device is connected, locates drivers for it, and installs and configures it, with minimal user input. In some cases, you may need to install the hardware vendor's driver before connecting the device. The vendor usually provides a setup program to accomplish this.\n\nNote: When using a 64-bit edition of Windows, you must obtain 64-bit device drivers. 32- bit drivers will not work.\n\nThere may also be circumstances where you need to install a device manually, disable or remove a device, or update a device's driver.\n\nADD HARDWARE WIZARD\nThe Add Hardware/Add a Device wizard (in Control Panel) supports the manual addition of devices while Device Manager (in Administrative Tools, the Computer Management snap-in, or Control Panel) is used to configure them.\n\nThe precise stages in the Add Hardware or Add a Device wizards are different between the various versions of Windows, but in all of them—by selecting the appropriate options—you can get to the point where you choose which hardware you want to install manually.\n\n(https://4sorcero.s3.amazonaws.com/byteback/core_2/fig_core_2_83.png)\nInstalling a device manually (Screenshot used with permission from Microsoft)\n\nChoose the type of hardware from the list then select from the list of manufacturers and models, and Windows will attempt to allocate it resources.\ntag:C2 L1 TE

DEVICES AND PRINTERS\n\nIn Windows 7 and Windows 8, Devices and Printers is the location for the basic user-configurable settings for peripheral devices attached to the computer. Double- clicking an icon brings up the device's status page and available configuration options (referred to as the Device Stage). The shortcut menu for each device also allows you to set configurable properties, start a troubleshooter (devices with an   icon are not working properly), or remove the device from the computer.\n\n(https://4sorcero.s3.amazonaws.com/byteback/core_2/fig_core_2_84a.png)\nDevices and Printers in Windows 7. (Screenshot used with permission from Microsoft.)\n\nTHE DEVICES PAGE\nIn Windows 10, the Devices page in Windows Settings provides options for adding and configuring peripherals.\n\n(https://4sorcero.s3.amazonaws.com/byteback/core_2/fig_core_2_84b.png)\nDevices page within the Windows 10 Settings app. (Screenshot used with permission from Microsoft.)\ntag:C2 L1 TE

DEVICE MANAGER\n\nWhen you have installed a device, check that it works. It is a good sign if the device is recognized by Windows, but you should still perform a functional test. For example, print a test page when installing a printer, test file copy when installing removable media, or test audio and video playback when installing multimedia devices.\n\nDevice Manager (devmgmt.msc) allows you to view and edit the properties of installed hardware. You can change device settings, update drivers, and resolve any known conflicts.\n\nVERIFYING DEVICE INSTALLATION\nBeyond installation of its driver, a device's configuration will include an interrupt address (IRQ) and various other properties, including memory addresses and I/O ranges. All hardware devices need a unique configuration so that they can communicate with the processor and other system components. Hopefully, if all your devices are fairly recent, Windows will be able to detect them and install them properly. There may be circumstances where you need to check the system resourcesassigned to a device, however. You can use the View menu in Device Manager to see which resources are assigned to which device.\n\n(https://4sorcero.s3.amazonaws.com/byteback/core_2/fig_core_2_85.png)\nManaging hardware with the Device Manager in Windows 10. (Screenshot used with permission from Microsoft.)\n\nUPDATING AND TROUBLESHOOTING A DEVICE\nSometimes Windows can determine a device's type and function, but cannot locate a driver for the device (perhaps there is no driver included on the Windows setup media or in Windows Update). In this case, you may find an "Unknown Device" or device of a "generic" type listed in the Device Manager with a yellow exclamation mark indicating a problem.\n\nIf the device has never worked, check that it (or the driver installed) is compatible with the OS. Manufacturers often release updated drivers to fix known problems. The update can normally be obtained as a download from the support area of the manufacturer's website. Once downloaded, the driver may come with a setup program. to install it or may need to be installed manually.\n\nNote: if a device is not working properly, a warning message is usually displayed in the notification area.\n\nTo update or troubleshoot a device manually, in the Device Manager hardware tree, locate the device, right-click it, and select Properties to display the device settings. The General tab displays status information for the device. Use the Update Driver button on the Drivers tab to install a new driver.\n\n(https://4sorcero.s3.amazonaws.com/byteback/core_2/fig_core_2_86.png)\nUsing device properties to investigate driver version. (Screenshot used with permission from Microsoft.)\n\nNote: When installing drivers, always check the laptop (or PC) vendor's site for an OEM version of the driver first. Devices used by system builders can be slightly different from retail versions and may need a different driver to work properly with the chipset and firmware. This is more often the case with laptops than desktop PCs.\n\nIf a device supports Plug-and-Play and is hot swappable, you can remove it from the computer without having to uninstall it. Before removing a storage device, close any applications that might be using it, then select the Safely Remove Hardware icon Il in the notification area on the taskbar and choose the option to stop or eject the device. Otherwise, you can uninstall a device prior to physically removing it by right- clicking in Device Manager and selecting Uninstall.\n\n(https://4sorcero.s3.amazonaws.com/byteback/core_2/fig_core_2_87.png)\nUsing Device Manager to uninstall a device. (Screenshot used with permission from Microsoft)\n\nThere is also an option in Device Manager to Disable a device, which you might use if it\nis not working with the current driver and want to make it inaccessible to users while\nyou find a replacement or to improve system security by disabling unused devices\n(such as modems). Disabled devices are shown with a down arrow.\ntag:C2 L1 TE

HARDWARE DIAGNOSTICS\n\nIf you cannot diagnose a hardware driver or configuration problem via Device Manager, there are other tools you can use to get more information.\n\nTROUBLESHOOTING APP\nWindows is bundled with a number of automated troubleshooting utilities. These guide you through the process of installing and configuring a device correctly. The troubleshooters are available from Control Panel in Windows 7 or the Settings app in Windows 10.\n\n(https://4sorcero.s3.amazonaws.com/byteback/core_2/fig_core_2_88.png)\nSelection of the troubleshooting tools in Windows 10.
