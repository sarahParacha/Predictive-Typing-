Lesson 3\nMaintaining and Troubleshooting Microsoft Windows\n\nLESSON INTRODUCTION\nYou have learned to use tools and features to install and configure devices and manage disks and file systems, These tasks are important but they are not the reason people and companies use computers. Computers are useful devices because they run different kinds of software applications. In this lesson, you will learn how to install and configure software in Windows.\n\nUsing the computer effectively also brings up the issues of performance and availability. If the computer is slow or unresponsive, users cannot work efficiently. This lesson will also show you how to monitor system performance and troubleshoot Windows OS problems.\n\nLESSON OBJECTIVES\nIn this lesson, you will:\n• Install and manage Windows applications.\n• Manage Windows performance.\n• Troubleshoot Windows issues.\ntag: C2 L3

Topic A\nInstall and Manage Windows Applications\n\nEXAM OBJECTIVES COVERED\n1002-1.4 Given a scenario, use appropriate Microsoft command-line tools\n1002-1.5 Given a scenario, use Microsoft operating system features and tools.\n1002-1.6 Given a scenario, use Microsoft Windows Control Panel utilities.\n1002-1.7 Summarize application installation and configuration concepts.\n\nInstalling and configuring software applications is a crucial part of the IT support role. In this topic, you will learn the tools and features used in Windows® to follow best practices for software management. You will also use Task Manager to examine processes and performance of the operating system and applications.\ntag: C2 L3 TA

APPLICATION INSTALLATION AND CONFIGURATION\n\nWhen you are selecting, installing, and configuring software applications, you need to consider both compatibility and security concepts.\n\nOS REQUIREMENTS (COMPATIBILITY)\nEvery software application is designed to run under a specific operating system. When purchasing, you need to make sure you select the version for your OS. You cannot purchase software for macOS* and then run it on Windows. Additionally, a software application might not be supported for use under newer operating systems. For example, if you have been using version 1 of the Widget App on Windows 7 and you subsequently upgrade to Windows 10, the Widget App might need to be upgraded to version 2 for full compatibility.\n\nSYSTEM REQUIREMENTS\nSystem requirements refers to the PC specification required to run the application. Some applications, such as 3D games, may have high requirements for CPU and GPU (graphics). There will also be specific RAM and disk space requirements:\n\n• Random Access Memory (RAM)—most applications will require at least 2 GB of system memory.\n\n• Drive space—applications can have quite high disk space requirements. For example, Microsoft Office needs at least 3 GB of disk space.\n\nThe application's documentation may specify additional requirements, such as a microphone, speakers, or headset.\n\nINSTALLATION AND DEPLOYMENT OPTIONS\nMost applications are installed from a setup file. The setup file packs the application's executable(s), configuration files, and media files within it. During setup, the files are extracted and installed to the program directory. A setup file can be distributed on CD/ DVD, it could be run from a USB drive, or it could be downloaded from the internet.\n\nWhen an organization wants to deploy an application to a number of desktops, they are likely to use a network-based installer. In this scenario, the setup file is simply copied to a shared folder on the network and client computers run the setup file from the network folder. In Windows, you can use policies—Group Policy Objects (6PO)—to set a computer to remotely install an application from a network folder without any manual intervention from an administrator. Products such as centrally managed anti-virus suites often support “push” deployment tools to remotely install the client or security sensor on each desktop.\n\nPERMISSIONS AND OTHER SECURITY CONSIDERATIONS\nOne advantage of using a tool such as GPO to deploy applications is that a user does not have to log on to the local client with administrator privileges. Write/modify permissions over folders to which the application executable files are installed are restricted to administrator-level accounts. This prevents unauthorized modification of the computer or the installation of programs that could threaten security policies. The setup file for a deployed application can run using a service account.\n\nTo run an application, the user needs to be granted read/execute permission over the application's installation directory. Any files created using the application or custom. settings/preferences specific to a particular user should be saved to the user's home. folder/profile rather than the application directory.\n\nWhen selecting applications for installation on desktops, proper security considerations need to be made in respect of potential impacts to the device (computer) and to the network. The principal threat is that of a Trojan Horse; that is, software whose true (malicious) purpose is concealed. Such malware is likely to be configured to try to steal data or provide covert remote access to the host or network once installed. A setup file could also be wittingly or unwittingly infected with a computer virus. These security issues can be mitigated by ensuring that software is only installed from trusted sources and that the installer code is digitally signed by a reputable software publisher.\n\nAs well as overt malware threats, software could impact the stability and performance of a computer or network. The software might consume more CPU and memory resource than anticipated or use an excessive amount of network bandwidth. There could be compatibility problems with other local or network applications. The software could contain unpatched vulnerabilities that could allow worm malware to propagate and crash the network. Ideally, applications should be tested in a lab environment before being deployed more widely. Research any security advisories associated with the software, and ensure that the developer has a robust approach to identifying and resolving security issues.\ntag: C2 L3 TA

WINDOWS PROGRAMS AND FEATURES\n\nIn Windows, local applications are installed to the Program Files directory on the boot partition (for example, C:\Program Files). Most applications will also write configuration data to the registry and may add folders and files to the user's home directory (or to the All Users directory for settings shared by all users). To ensure that all these folders, files, and registry settings are created correctly, applications should be installed and removed using the supplied Setup program.\n\nNote: Application installation and removal under legacy versions of Windows could cause problems if an application changed or removed DLL (Dynamic Link Library) files used by other applications, causing them to malfunction. Microsoft introduced the Windows installer Service to mitigate these problems. Most application vendors use setup programs that are compliant with Windows Installer (Windows Installer packages have .MSI extensions). System Restore can also be configured to create a Restore Point automatically upon application installation, adding a further measure of protection.\n\n64-BIT WINDOWS AND 32-BIT APPLICATIONS\nMany of the software applications available for Windows are still 32-bit. These applications can usually be installed under 64-bit versions of Windows. They run within a special application environment called WOWed (Windows on Windows 64-bit). This environment replicates the 32-bit environment expected by the application and translates its requests into ones that can be processed by the 64-bit CPU, memory, and file subsystems.\n\nIn a 64-bit Windows environment, 32-bit application files are installed to the Program Files (x86) folder while 64-bit applications are stored in Program Files (unless the user chooses custom installation options). Windows’ 64-bit shared system files (DLLs and. EXEs) are stored in %SystemRoot%\system32; that is, the same system folder as 32-bit versions of Windows. Files for the 32-bit versions are stored in %SystemRoot%\syswow64.\n\nNote: A 32-bit version of Windows cannot run 64-bit applications.\n\nINSTALLING A DESKTOP APPLICATION\nLaunch the program's setup application and complete the setup wizard to install it. in order to install a program successfully, you should exit any other applications or files. You may also need to disable anti-virus software.\n\nUSING PROGRAMS AND FEATURES\nPrograms and Features allows you to uninstall a program or add or remove component features of software such as Microsoft Office. There is also usually a repair option, which will reinstall the components of the program.\n\n(https://4sorcero.s3.amazonaws.com/byteback/core_2/fig_core_2_178.png)\nPrograms and Features—select a program icon then use the options to uninstall, change. or repair (Screenshot used with permission from Microsoft)\n\nNote: In order to uninstall a program successfully, you should exit any applications or files that might lock files installed by the application or the PC will need to be restarted, You may also need to disable anti-virus software, If the uninstall program cannot remove locked files, it will normally prompt you to check its log file for details (the files and directories can then be deleted manually).\n\nENABLING WINDOWS FEATURES\nYou can use Programs and Features to enable or disable optional Windows components. Click the Turn Windows features on or off link then check the boxes for the features you want to enable (or uncheck boxes to remove those features).\n\n(https://4sorcero.s3.amazonaws.com/byteback/core_2/fig_core_2_179.png)\nEnabling and disabling Windows Features.

SOFTWARE CONFIGURATION\n\nMost configuration options for software are quite specific to each program. You can use menus such as File→Options, Edit→Preferences, or the Help menu to change the configuration settings.\n\nDEFAULT PROGRAMS\nUse the Default Programs applet to set the programs you wish to use for particular tasks of to configure individual file associations (choosing which application is used to open files with a particular extension).\n\n(https://4sorcero.s3.amazonaws.com/byteback/core_2/fig_core_2_180.png)\nDefault Programs applet in Windows 8.1. (Screenshot used with permission from Microsoft)\n\nNote: In Windows 10, select Windows Settings→Apps→Default apps.\n\nCOMPATIBILITY MODE\nOne of the challenges for Microsoft in releasing a new version of Windows is to provide compatibility for hardware and software developed for previous versions.\n\nWindows provides a degree of support for legacy DOS and Windows 9x programs, and each version provides support for earlier 2000/XP/Vista/7/8 versions. The Properties dialog box for executable files and the shortcuts to such programs have a Compatibility tab. It allows you to configure the program's original operating system environment and force it to use compatible display settings.\n\n(https://4sorcero.s3.amazonaws.com/byteback/core_2/fig_core_2_181.png)\nAccess program compatibility options via the application's executable or shortcut file properties. (Screenshot used with permission from Microsoft.)\n\nFeatures such as User Account Control and its greater protection for system folders (Program Files and the system root), the Aero desktop compositing engine, and 64-bit Windows versions have made application compatibility even more challenging. UAC problems can be solved by running the program as an administrator, and there is an option to turn off advanced desktop compositing effects. There is a Program Compatibility Troubleshooter wizard (right-click the shortcut or executable) to help.\n\nMICROSOFT STORE APPS\nWindows 8 introduces support for a different kind of program, referred to variously as a Windows app, Store app, Universal app, or Modern/Metro app. These apps run across any kind of Windows device, including Windows-based smartphones and tablets. Windows apps are not installed via Programs and Features but via the Microsoft Store.\n\nUsers must sign into the Microsoft Store using a Microsoft account. Apps can be transferred between any Windows device where the user signs in with that Microsoft account.\n\n(https://4sorcero.s3.amazonaws.com/byteback/core_2/fig_core_2_182 .png)\nMicrosoft Store. (Screenshot used with permission from Microsoft)\n\nUnlike desktop applications, store apps run in a restrictive sandbox. This sandbox is designed to prevent a store app from making system-wide changes and prevent a faulty store app from "crashing" the whole OS or interfering with other apps and applications. This extra level of protection means that users with only standard permissions are allowed to install store apps. Installing a store app does not require confirmation with UAC or computer administrator-level privileges.\n\nApps can be uninstalled via the app's shortcut menu on the Start Screen. You can choose to uninstall an app from that device only or from all devices, wiping any data stored by the app in your account in the process.\ntag: C2 L3 TA

APPLICATION AND PRINT SERVICES\n\nA service is a Windows process that does not require any sort of user interaction and so runs in the background (without a window). Services provide functionality for many parts of the Windows OS, such as allowing logon, browsing the network, or indexing file details to optimize searches. Services may be installed by Windows and by other applications, such as antivirus, database, or backup software.\n\nSERVICES CONSOLE\nYou might want to disable non-essential services to improve performance or security. You can prevent a service from running at startup by setting it to Manual or prevent it from running completely by setting it to Disabled. Note that this may cause problems if other services depend upon it. If something is not working properly, you should check that any services it depends upon are started.\n\n(https://4sorcero.s3.amazonaws.com/byteback/core_2/fig_core_2_183a.png)\nManaging services using the Computer Management console. (Screenshot used with permission from Microsoft.)\n\nTo configure services, open the Computer Management console, then expand Services and Applications from the tree and click the Services icon. Alternatively, you can run the services.msc command. The services snap-in displays a list of installed services in the right-hand panel. Clicking a service displays information about it in the left-hand panel. The shortcut menu for a service allows you to start, stop, pause/ resume, or restart (stop then start).\n\nPRINT MANAGEMENT\nIf you use Windows to host a printer (acting as a print server), you need to make drivers available for the different client operating systems that may be connecting to the printer. Windows comes with a Print Management snap-in (in Administrative Tools), where you can manage drivers and monitor the status of printers.\n\n(https://4sorcero.s3.amazonaws.com/byteback/core_2/fig_core_2_183b.png)\nPrint Management (Windows 7). (Screenshot used with permission from Microsoft)\n\nNote: Note that Print Management is not available in the Home editions.\n\nCOMPONENT SERVICES\nThe Component Object Model (COM+, Distributed COM [DCOM], and Activex) is a means for developers to link software applications and leverage Windows services. For example, COM OLE (Object Linking and Embedding) allows an Excel® spreadsheet to be saved within a Word document or a custom software application could use COM to write to the event log, The Component Services snap-in (accessed via Administrative Tools) enables you to register new server applications or reconfigure security permissions for existing services.\n\nDATA SOURCES\nThe Data Sources or ODBC Data Sources snap-in (from Administrative Tools) enables you to control data connections set up on the local computer. A data source allows a client application to share data from a server application. For example, an Excel spreadsheet could be set up with a data connection to an SQL Server®.\n\n(https://4sorcero.s3.amazonaws.com/byteback/core_2/fig_core_2_184.png)\nChecking available drivers using the Data Sources snap-in. (Screenshot used with permission from Microsoft)\n\nAn Open Database Connectivity (ODBC) data source consists of a driver for the server application plus the location of the data (a file or a server). You may also need to supply the table name and logon credentials. Typically, drivers get added when an application is installed.\n\nUsers can set up new data sources using the My Data Sources folder that gets added within their Documents folder in their profile.\ntag: C2 L3 TA

TASK MANAGER\n\nThe Task Manager utility (taskmgr.exe) allows the user to shut down applications that are not responding. An ordinary user can end an unresponsive application that they ran initially, but administrative rights are required to end processes that were not started by the user. This protects the system by ensuring malware cannot disable antivirus software or other protections. In addition to this functionality, Task Manager can be used to monitor the PC's key resources. The quickest way to open Task Manager is to press Ctrl+Shift+Esc.\n\nNote: Other ways to open Task Manager include pressing Ctrl+Alt+Del and selecting Task Manager, right-clicking the taskbar, and running taskmgr.exe\n\nTask Manager has been significantly overhauled in Windows 8 and Windows 10. First we examine the Windows 7 version and the Windows 10 version follows after.\n\nAPPLICATIONS TAB\nThe Applications tab shows applications currently running in a desktop window. The shortcut menu for each allows you to force the application to close (End Task), manage its window, and show the process associated with the application.\n \n(https://4sorcero.s3.amazonaws.com/byteback/core_2/fig_core_2_185.png)\nWindows 7 Task Manager→Applications tab. (Screenshot used with permission from Microsoft)\n\nIf an application is not responding, forcing it to close may result in the loss of any unsaved data. You are prompted to confirm what you want to do.\n\n(https://4sorcero.s3.amazonaws.com/byteback/core_2/fig_core_2_186a.png)\nProgram not responding dialog box. (Screenshot used with permission from Microsoft)\n\nSome applications, including Microsoft Office ones, can try to recover unsaved information from autosave and temp files.\n\nPROCESSES TAB\nThe Processes tab shows CPU utilization and memory usage for each process.\n\n(https://4sorcero.s3.amazonaws.com/byteback/core_2/fig_core_2_186b.png)\nWindows 7 Task Manager→Processes tab. (Screenshot used with permission from Microsoft.)\n\nTo view system-level processes (those not running under the logged-on user account), you must select the Show processes from all users option.\n\nYou would examine these values to discover whether a particular application was misbehaving. For example, an application may "leak" memory by not freeing it up when it has finished using it. To show more than the default CPU and Memory Usage, select View--Select Columns and check the items that you want to look at.\n\nIf a process is not responding or if you suspect it is faulty, you can right-click and select End Process to terminate it.\n\nIn some circumstances, you may want to privilege one task over another, or conversely, set one task to have fewer resources than others. You can do this by right clicking the process and choosing an option from the Set Priority submenu. For example, if you had a Voice over IP application and its priority was not already set to Above normal, changing its priority might improve call quality as the CPU would privilege that process over ones set to any other level.\n\nNote: As with other administrative tools, some settings in Task Manager (such as showing system level processes) are not available unless you run the tool with administrative privileges.\n\nYou can choose to open the folder containing the process and inspect its file properties. This can be useful if you suspect a malware infection—you should check that the process is installed to a valid location. Sometimes a single process (such as svchost.exe) will "host" multiple services; conversely, there may be multiple versions of the process running, You can use the Go to Service(s) option in the process's shortcut menu to view them.\n\nNote: Use the File menu to launch a new process. You can choose to launch the process with administrative privileges by checking the box.\n\nSERVICES TAB\nYou can use the Services tab to show which services are running, start and stop services, or open the services management console. Each running service is associated with a host process through its Process 1D (PID). You can use the Go to Process option in the process's shortcut menu to view it.\n\n(https://4sorcero.s3.amazonaws.com/byteback/core_2/fig_core_2_188.png)\nWindows 7 Task Manager—Services tab. (Screenshot used with permission from Microsoft)\n\nPERFORMANCE TAB\nThe Processes tab shows which applications might be using (or over-using) system resources. You can also use Task Manager to get a snapshot of overall system performance. Select the Performance tab to view resource usage. On a system with multiple processors, you should see multiple graphs for CPU Usage (one for each CPU). If this is not the case, select View-» CPU History» One Graph per CPU. Note that physical, multicore, and HyperThreaded processors are all represented.\n\n(https://4sorcero.s3.amazonaws.com/byteback/core_2/fig_core_2_189.png)\nWindows 7 Task Manager→Performance tab. (Screenshot used with permission from Microsoft.)\n\nThe following memory usage is displayed:\n\n• Physical Memory—usage of system RAM (not including the pagefile).\n\n• Kernel Memory—physical and paged memory used by Windows core files.\n\n• System summary—showing handles, threads, and processes (software objects being managed by the CPU), system uptime, and the commit charge (overall memory usage, including physical memory and pagefile).\n\nHigh peak values are nothing to worry about, but consistently high utilization means that you should consider adding more resources to the system (or run fewer processes!) CPU and physical memory obviously require physical upgrades. Windows will normally change the pagefile dynamically if it is running out of space. If it has been set manually, you should increase it using the Performance Settings button on the Advanced page of System Properties.\n\nNote: If the commit charge exceeds total physical memory, then performance will suffer a3 the system will be using the disk-based pagefile extensively. You need to multiply the commit charge (measured here in gigabytes) by 1024 to compare to physical memory (measured in megabytes).\n\nThere is also a link to Resource Monitor, which shows additional live performance information.\n\nNETWORKING TAB\nThe Networking tab shows the status and utilization of the network adapter(s).. Utilization is expressed as a percentage, so if the link is 10 Gbps (as shown), 10% utilization shows that the computer is transferring about 1 Gbps currently.\n\n(https://4sorcero.s3.amazonaws.com/byteback/core_2/fig_core_2_190 .png)\nWindows 7 Task Manager→Networking tab. (Screenshot used with permission from Microsoft)\n\nUSERS TAB\nThe Users tab shows who is logged on to the machine. An administrator can disconnect or log off other users or send them a notification (to inform them that the computer will be shut down, for instance).\n\nWINDOWS 10 TASK MANAGER\nIn Windows 10, you can open Task Manager via the Ctrl+Shift+Esc key combo, by right-clicking the taskbar, or by using the Windows+X menu. Task Manager may start in a "compact" mode; click the Show details button to expand it.\n\nNote: Task Manager in Windows 8 is essentially the same as in Windows 10\n\nIn Windows 10, the functions of the Applications and Processes tabs are consolidated across the Processes and Details tabs. On the Processes tab, you can expand each app or background process to view its sub-processes and view more clearly what resources each is taking up.\n\nThe shortcut menu allows you to end a task. There is also an option to search for information about the process online. Another option is to view more information about a process via the Details tab. You can identify services associated with a process via the shortcut menu on the Details tab.\n\n(https://4sorcero.s3.amazonaws.com/byteback/core_2/fig_core_2_191a.png)\nWindows 10 Task Manager→Processes tab. (Screenshot used with permission from Microsoft)\n\nThe Performance tab provides more information about the CPU, memory, disk, and network subsystems, while the App History tab shows usage information for Windows Store apps.\n\n(https://4sorcero.s3.amazonaws.com/byteback/core_2/fig_core_2_191b.png)\nWindows 10 Task Manager→Performance tab. (Screenshot used with permission from Microsoft)\n\nThe Users tab lets you see who is logged on (and allows you to send them a message or sign them out) plus information about the processes they are running and the resource utilization associated with their account.\n\n(https://4sorcero.s3.amazonaws.com/byteback/core_2/fig_core_2_192.png)\nWindows 10 Task Manager→Users tab. (Screenshot used with permission from Microsoft.)\n\nThe Startup tab lets you disable programs added to the Startup folder (type shell: startup at the Run dialog box to access this) or set to run using the registry. Right-click the headers and select Startup type to show how the program is launched. It also shows how much impact each item has on boot times.\n\nThe tasklist and taskkill Commands\nYou can also identify which service is running in which process (and vice versa) at a command line using the tasklist command. tasklist shows list of processes (images) along with a PID, session name and number, and memory usage (in kilobytes). You can run the command with the /fi switch to apply various filters (for example, tasklist /fi "memusage gt 150000" shows processes using more than 150 MB)—check the online help for details. Using tasklist ./sve shows a list of services within each process.\n\nThe taskkill command can be used to end processes and services. Use taskkill /pid processid or taskkill /im ImageName to end a task by PID or image name respectively. Use the /t switch to also halt any child processes.\n\nThe /f switch terminates the process without any user notification (for the user to save changes, for instance) and will also terminate it even if it is currently displaying dialog box. You can run the command with an appropriate filter (/fi "Criteria". You can use a PID, image name, service name, or window title or target multiple images using a filter for CPU time, memory usage, or status ("Not Responding," for instance).\n\nNote: There may be circumstances when you need to run Explorer with administrative privileges. To do this, open a command prompt using Run as administrator. Use taskkill /f /im explorer.exe to terminate the existing Explorer process, then run explorer.exe again from the same command prompt.\n\nNote: On a network, you can use taskkill and tasklist to manage processes on a remote computer using the /s switch to identify the remote host (by IP address or host name) and the /w and /p switches to specify credentials (user name and password).\ntag: C2 L3 TA

Activity 3-1\nDiscussing Windows Application Management\n\nSCENARIO\nAnswer the following questions to check your understanding of the topic.\n\n1. You need to install a desktop application across a network of 500 Windows PCs.\n\nWhat is the most efficient means of doing this, and what security considerations should you make?\n\n2. An installer program may present up to three options in Programs and Features. Two are Uninstall and Change.\n\nWhat is the third?\n\n3. How would you configure a legacy Windows 98 application to work with Windows 10?\n\n4. You take a support call where the user doesn't understand why a program runs at startup when the Startup folder is empty.\n\nWhat is the likely cause and how could you verify this?\n\n5. What additional information is shown on the Users tab in Windows 10 Task Manager compared to Windows 7?\n\n6. You are watching CPU Usage and notice that it often jumps to 100% and then falls back.\n\nDoes this indicate a problem?\ntag: C2 L3 TA A3-1

Activity 3-2\nConfiguring Windows Applications and Services\n\nBEFORE YOU BEGIN\nComplete this activity on the Hyper-V Manager and the PC1 (Windows 10) and PC2 (Windows 7) VMs.\n\nSCENARIO\nIn this activity, you will explore a software compatibility issue and look at the Services snap-in and Task Manager tools.\n\n1. Windows can run software in an environment that simulates older versions of Windows to try to solve compatibility problems. On the PC2 VM, use the C:\LABFILES\pgpfreeware.exe program to explore compatibility troubleshooting options.\n\na) Open the Hyper-V Manager window. In the Virtual Machines panel, right-click PC2 and select Start. Double-click the VM to open the connection window.\n\nb) Press Ctrl+Alt+End to show the sign-on screen. Select Switch User→Other User to Use a different account to the one shown initially. In the User name box, type \Admin. Type Pa$$w0rd in the other box, and then press Enter.\n\n©) Start Windows Explorer and open the C:\LABFILES folder.\n\nd) Double-click the PGPfreeware.exe file to run it.\n\ne) Select OK to dismiss the error message. On the taskbar, select the Program Compatibility Assistant window icon, and then select the Close button.\n\nf) Right-click the executable and select Troubleshoot compatibility.\n\ng) Select Try recommended settings, and then select Start the program.\n\nh) At the UAC prompt, select Yes to continue with the installation.\nIn this instance it is safe to proceed, but on a production network you should be much more cautious about installing unsigned software.\n\ni) Cancel any error messages, but leave the troubleshooter open.\n\nj) In the Program Compatibility troubleshooter, select Next, and then select No, try again using different settings.\n\nk) Check The program worked in earlier versions of Windows but won't install or run now, and then select Next.\n\nl) Select Windows 95 and select Next.\n\nm) Select Start the program.\n\nn) At the UAC prompt, select Yes to continue with the installation.\nThe program will still not install.\n\no) Cancel the error messages.\n\np) In the Program Compatibility troubleshooter, select Next, then select No, report the problem to Microsoft and check online for a solution.\n\nq) Select the Close button.\n\nIn this instance, the software is just not compatible with Windows 7, and you would have to look at the vendor's site for an updated version or create a Windows 9x Virtual Machine (VM) to use to run the program.\n\n2. Open Task Manager, and observe the status information as you run the HeavyLoad PC "stress test” tool. HeavyLoad is developed by JAM Software (jam-software.com).\n\na) Right-click the taskbar and select Start Task Manager. Observe the Applications tab, You might have some Explorer instances running,\n\nb) Select the Processes tab, and observe the background processes running under the user account.\n\nc) Select the Performance tab, and observe how much of the VM's resources are committed just to running Windows itself.\n\nd) Select Options→Always On Top.\n\n2) On the desktop, double-click the HeavyLoad icon.\n\nf) In HeavyLoad, use the Test Options menu or the toolbar buttons to use the following tests:\n• Write Temp File - Enabled\n• Allocate Memory - Enabled\n• Start TreeSize - Disabled\n• Stress GPU - Disabled\n\n(https://4sorcero.s3.amazonaws.com/byteback/core_2/fig_core_2_197.png)\n\ng) Select File→Start Selected Tests.\n\nh) In Task Manager, verify that CPU Usage graph shows the point at which HeavyLoad was launched.\n\ni) Check the Applications and Processes tabs in Task Manager, and observe the CPU and memory utilization for the HeavyLoad.exe process.\n\nj) Optionally, try starting some of the installed applications, such as Thunderbird or Nmap, using the desktop shortcuts. Observe if there is any effect on performance, such as taking a long time to display a window (there may not be).\n\nk) Watch for a Low Disk Space Warning notification as the HeavyLoad temp file reduces spare disk capacity.\n\nl) In HeavyLoad, select File Stop Tests. Observe Task Manager as CPU utilization drops and more memory is made available.\n\nm) Exit the HeavyLoad application.\n\n3. Use Task Manager to list running services and identify the processes that are hosting services.\n\na) Select the Services tab and sort by Status.\nNote the number of services is far higher than the number of processes seen previously. Also note that each service has a PID (Process ID).\n\nb) Select the Processes tab then select the Show processes from all users button. Services running under the system, local service, and network service machine accounts are shown.\n\nc) Select View- Select Columns. Check PID and select OK.\nNote the number of svchost.exe processes running and that these have the same PID as many of the services you looked at, Svchostis a generic process for running many Windows services.\n\nd) Right-dick a svchost.exe process and select Go to Service(s) to switch back to the Services tab. Services running within that svchost.exe process image are selected.\nNote that they have the same PID.\n\n4. Some services are essential but others can be disabled to reduce startup time or make more system memory available. Practice managing services by disabling the Themes service.\n\na) In Task Manager, on the Services tab, locate the Themes service. Right-click it and select Stop Service.\n\nNote the change to the desktop when the service is not running.\n\n(https://4sorcero.s3.amazonaws.com/byteback/core_2/fig_core_2_198.png)\nWith the Themes service disabled, desktop compositing effects are not available, so the taskbar and window borders look much plainer. (Screenshot used with permission from Microsoft.)\n\nb) Minimize Task Manager.\n\nc) Open the Computer Management console, expand Services and Applications, and then select Services in the left pane.\nThis snap-in lets you manage services. These are Windows and third-party processes that run in the background to support functions of Windows and third-party applications.

SYSTEM PROPERTIES\n\nYou can obtain a brief overview of some key system information from the System Properties applet. You can access this via Control Panel or by right-clicking the Computer/This PC object and selecting Properties. The System Properties home page displays summary information about the computer, including the processor type and installed RAM, plus the Windows edition, product key, and activation status. The system settings include network identification and domain membership, hardware settings and configuration, user profiles, and performance and recovery options. Select the Tasks or Advanced system settings links to access the configuration dialog boxes.\n\n(https://4sorcero.s3.amazonaws.com/byteback/core_2/fig_core_2_200.png)\nWindows 7 system properties.

ADVANCED SYSTEM PROPERTIES\n\nFrom the System applet, clicking Advanced system settings opens the System Properties dialog box. This allows you to configure remote settings, system protection, and advanced settings.\n\nREMOTE SETTINGS\nThe Remote Settings tab enables (or disables) connections to the local PC from another PC on the network. There are two types of remote connection:\n\n• Remote Assistance means that the local user sends a request to another user on a remote computer inviting them to view or control their desktop,\n\n• Remote Desktop means that the remote user can initiate a connection at any time. The remote user needs to sign on to the local machine using an authorized account (configured via this dialog box).\n\n(https://4sorcero.s3.amazonaws.com/byteback/core_2/fig_core_2_202.png)\nSystem Properties dialog box—Remote Settings tab in Windows 10. (Screenshot used with permission from Microsoft)\n\nSYSTEM PROTECTION\nThe System Protection tab provides options for configuring the System Restore feature. System Restore creates configuration backups. If there are changes or file corruptions that damage information in the registry or you want to reverse changes made when installing an application or device driver, you can use System Restore to reset the system configuration to an earlier point in time. Click Configure to enable or disable System Protection and set how much disk space the tool is allowed to use.\n\n(https://4sorcero.s3.amazonaws.com/byteback/core_2/fig_core_2_203.png)\nSystem Properties dialog box—System Protection tab in Windows 10.

VIRTUAL MEMORY\n\nUsing virtual memory is a way for the computer to accomplish more than the limits of what its physical memory can perform. The computer system uses a portion of the hard disk as if it was physical RAM. When all physical memory is filled, the OS can transfer some of the least-recently used data from memory to a file on the hard disk called the pagefile, thereby freeing up an equivalent amount of space in the memory chips for other purposes. When the original data is needed again, the next least- recently used data is moved out of RAM onto the hard drive to make room to reimport the needed data.\n\nIn Windows systems, the Virtual Memory Manager (VMM) manages the memory mappings and assignments Running out of memory would mean that a process might not be able to start or could crash.\n\n(https://4sorcero.s3.amazonaws.com/byteback/core_2/fig_core_2_205a .png)\nVirtual memory. (image © 123RF.com.)\n\nVirtual memory is not nearly as fast as actual memory. Modern DDRx SDRAM DIMMs read/write speeds are measured in nanoseconds, whereas hard drive seek, read, and write times are measured in milliseconds. If your computer is frequently exceeding physical RAM and having to resort to using a pagefile on disk, adding more physical RAM may be the most economical way of effecting a noticeable change in performance.\n\n(https://4sorcero.s3.amazonaws.com/byteback/core_2/fig_core_2_205b.png)\nConfiguring virtual memory in Windows 10. (Screenshot used with permission from Microsoft)\n\nWhen tuning the pagefile, keep the following in mind:\n\n• Windows can manage the pagefile and set an appropriate level. There is very little point in setting custom values unless you have a specific performance goal or requirement in mind.\n\n• Each physical disk can have a pagefile of its own. This will allow Windows, depending on hardware, to concurrently access the paging files and, therefore, increase performance.\n\n• The pagefile does not have to use contiguous disk space, although performance can be further enhanced if it does. To ensure that the pagefile uses contiguous space, you will need to defragment your disk then set the maximum and minimum sizes of the pagefile to the same value.\n\nNote: If the pagefile is a fixed size but too small, Windows might run out of memory, which could cause programs to crash. Also, if the pagefile is too small, the system may not be able to generate a complete crash dump of the memory contents, which will hamper efforts to troubleshoot system errors.\n\nFor more information on pagefile tuning considerations, view Microsoft's Knowledge Base article (https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/2860880/how-to-determine-the- appropriate-page-file-size-for-64-bit-versions-of).\ntag: C2 L3 TB

WINDOWS PERFORMANCE MANAGEMENT TOOLS\n\nWindows provides numerous Administrative Tools to monitor system performance.\n\n• Task Manager—as you have seen, you can use the Performance tab in Task Manager to monitor utilization statistics in real time.\n\n• Resource Monitor—shows an enhanced version of the sort of snapshot monitoring provided by Task Manager. You can see graphs of resource performance along with key statistics, such as threads started by a process or hard page faults/second. Continually rising numbers of either of these can indicate a problem.\n\n• Reliability Monitor—displays a log of "system stability" events, so you can see at a glance whether a particular application has stopped responding frequently.\n\n• Performance Monitor—configure detailed reports on different system statistics and log performance over time.\n\nPERFORMANCE MONITOR\nWindows Performance Monitor can be used to provide real-time charts of system resources or can be used to log information to a file for long-term analysis. You can run the tool from the Administrative Tools folder or Computer Management; you can also run perfmon.exe.\n\nBy monitoring different resources at different times of the day, you can detect bottlenecks in a system that are causing problems. It may be that a particular application starts freezing for longer and longer periods. This could be caused by a number of things. Perhaps it is that the processor is too slow, which would cause the requests to take longer; perhaps the hard disk is too slow, which would mean that takes too long for the computer to open and save files; perhaps the application uses a network link that has become faulty or congested.\n\n(https://4sorcero.s3.amazonaws.com/byteback/core_2/fig_core_2_207.png)\nPerformance Monitor in Windows 8.1. (Screenshot used with permission from Microsoft.)\n\nThe performance of the computer could be increased by upgrading any or all of these components, but Performance Monitor will help you decide which is critical.\n\nADDING OBJECTS, COUNTERS, AND INSTANCES\nResources, such as memory and disk, are collected into objects. Objects have counters, representing different performance statistics, and there can be multiple instances of the same type of object. For example, disk performance can be measured using the Physical Disk Object, and a useful counter is the Average Queue Length. If there are two disks, three instances of this object can be viewed: disk 0, disk 1, and disks Total.\n\nSome of the most commonly used counters are listed here:\n\n(https://4sorcero.s3.amazonaws.com/byteback/core_2/table_core_2_207.png)\n(https://4sorcero.s3.amazonaws.com/byteback/core_2/table_core_2_208.png)\n(https://4sorcero.s3.amazonaws.com/byteback/core_2/table_core_2_209.png)\n\nObject | Counter | Description\nProcessor | % Processor Time | The percentage of time that the processor is executing a non-idle thread. In general terms, this should be low. If it is greater than 85% for a sustained period, you may have a processor bottleneck.\n\nProcessor | % Privileged Time % User time | If overall processor time is very high (over 85% for sustained periods), it can be helpful to compare these. Privileged time represents system processes, whereas user time is software applications. If privileged time is much higher, it is likely that the CPU is underpowered (it can barely run Windows core processes efficiently).\n\nPhysical Disk | % Disk Time | The percentage of elapsed time that the selected disk drive is busy servicing read or write requests. This is a good overall indicator of how busy the disk is. Again, if the average exceeds 85% for a sustained period, you may have a disk problem.\n\nPhysical Disk | Average Disk Queue Length | The number of requests  outstanding on the disk at the time the performance data is collected. Taken with the preceding counter, this gives a better indicator of disk problems. For example, if the disk queue length is increasing and disk time is high, then you have a disk problem.\n\nMemory | Available Bytes | The amount of memory available—this should not be below about 10% of total system RAM. If available bytes falls continuously, there could be a memory leak (that is, a process that allocates memory but does not release it again).\n\nMemory | Pages/sec | The number of pages read from or written to disk to resolve hard page faults. This means your system is using the paging file. Nothing wrong as long as this is not excessive (averaging above about 50). You probably also want to check the paging file's usage by viewing the paging object itself.\n\nPaging File | % Usage | The amount of the pagefile instance in use in percent. If your paging file is currently 1000 MB on the disk and this figure averages 50%, then it means you might benefit from adding memory (about 500 MB, in fact). Don't forget that if your system pages excessively, then disk performance suffer—paging is disk intensive.\n\nNotice that it is not always immediately apparent which component is causing a problem. Many counters are interrelated and must be viewed with other counters in mind. For instance, if your system memory is low, then the disk will likely be slow because of excessive paging.\n\nLOGGING PERFORMANCE\nIn Performance Monitor, you can create log files, referred to as Data Collector Sets,  to record information for viewing at a later date. You can generate a library of  performance measurements taken at different times of the day, week, or even year. This information can provide a system baseline and then be used to give a longer-term view of system performance. There are two types of logs: counter and trace:\n\n• Counter logs allow you to collect statistics about resources, such as memory, disk, and processor. These can be used to determine system health and performance.\n\n• Trace logs can collect statistics about services, providing you with detailed reports about resource behavior. In essence, trace logs provide extensions to the Event Viewer, logging data that would otherwise be inaccessible.\n\nSaved log files can be loaded into Performance Monitor from the Reports folder for analysis or exported to other programs.\ntag: C2 L3 TB

Plenty of tools are available to diagnose and recover from different kinds of problems. in this topic, you will learn which tools and techniques can help to resolve some of the common Windows OS problem symptoms.\ntag: C2 L3 TC

EVENT VIEWER\n\nWhen a problem is related to Windows or a software application rather than the computer hardware, there will often be an error message associated with the problem. This makes troubleshooting simpler as you may only need to find out what the error message means using product documentation, the Microsoft Knowledge Base, or useful websites and newsgroups.\n\nThe Event Viewer (eventvwr.msc) is a management console snap-in for viewing, and managing system logs. It can also be accessed via Computer Management or Administrative Tools. The default page shows a summary of system status, with recent error and warning events collected for viewing.\n\n(https://4sorcero.s3.amazonaws.com/byteback/core_2/fig_core_2_211.png)\nWindows 10 Event Viewer. (Screenshot used with permission from Microsoft,\n\nThe three-part pane view lets you see the details of the selected event in the bottom pane without having to open a separate dialog box. The third pane contains useful tools for opening log files, filtering, creating a task from an event, and so on.\n\nDEFAULT LOG FILES\nThe principal Windows log files are shown in this table.\n\n(https://4sorcero.s3.amazonaws.com/byteback/core_2/table_core_2_212a.png)\n\nSystem Log: Contains information about service load failures, hardware conflicts, driver load failures, and so on.\n\nSecurity Log: This log holds the audit data for the system.\n\nApplication Log: Contains information regarding application errors.\n\nSetup: Records events generated during installation.\n\nThe files (application.evtx, security.evtx, system.evtx, and setup.evtx) are stored (by default) in the %SystemRoot%\System32\Winevt\Logs\ folder.\n\nNote: You can also log boot events by using msconfig: This boot log file is saved to %SystemRoot%\ntbtlog.txt. It is not shown in Event Viewer, though.\n\nEach log file has a default maximum size (usually about 20 MB), but you can change this by selecting Properties on the appropriate log. This option also allows the overwrite option to be set either as overwrite, do not overwrite, or archive (close the current file and start a new one).\n\nNote: Be careful about preserving logs. Many computers have ample free disk space, but archive logs can grow very large if left unmonitored.\n\nThere are many other logs, stored under the Applications and Services Logs node. You would investigate these when troubleshooting a particular Windows service or third-party application.\n\nEVENT TYPES\nThe Event Viewer displays each line or item in the source log file as an event and categorizes each event. The types of events are shown here.\n\n(https://4sorcero.s3.amazonaws.com/byteback/core_2/table_core_2_212b.png)\n(https://4sorcero.s3.amazonaws.com/byteback/core_2/table_core_2_213.png)\n\nInformation: Significant events that describe successful operations, such as a driver or service starting or a document printing.\n\nWarning: Events that may indicate future problems, such as when the system runs low on disk space.\n\nError: Significant problems, such as service failures and device conflicts.\n\nCritical: An unrecoverable error that made the application or Windows close unexpectedly.\n\nSuccessful Audit: Security access attempts that were successful.\n\nFailure Audit: Security access attempts that were unsuccessful. This may indicate a possible security breach or simply a user mistyping a password.\n\nMore information for each event can be displayed by double-clicking the event in question. This displays a screen that contains the date and time of the event, the user and computer name, an event ID, source, type, and category, and a description of the event and the data in bytes and words.\ntag: C2 L3 TC

THE SYSTEM CONFIGURATION UTILITY\n\nThe System Configuration Utility (msconfig) is used to modify various settings and files that affect the way the computer boots and loads Windows.\n\nNote: The msconfig tool is frequently used to test various configurations for diagnostic purposes, rather than to permanently make configuration changes. Following diagnostic testing, permanent changes would typically be made with more appropriate tools, such as Services, to change the startup settings of various system services.\n\nGENERAL TAB\nThe General tab allows you to configure the startup mode, choosing between Normal,  Diagnostic, and a Selective startup, where each portion of the boot sequence can be selected.\n\n(https://4sorcero.s3.amazonaws.com/byteback/core_2/fig_core_2_213.png)\nSystem Configuration Utility→General tab.

(Screenshot used with permission from Microsoft)\n\nYou can change the default 05, add boot options, such as Safe boot, with minimal drivers and services, and set the timeout value—the duration for which the boot options menu is displayed. To add boot paths you have to use the bcdedit command.\n\nNote: if you are troubleshooting a system that keeps using Safe boot or boots to a command prompt, check that one of the previous options has not been made permanent in System Configuration.\n\nSERVICES TAB\nThe Services tab lets you choose specifically which services are configured to run at startup. The date that a service was disabled is also shown, to make troubleshooting easier.\n\n(https://4sorcero.s3.amazonaws.com/byteback/core_2/fig_core_2_215a.png)\nSystem Configuration Utility→Services tab, (Screenshot used with permission from Microsoft)\n\nSTARTUP TAB\nIn Windows 7, the Startup tab controls the shortcuts that have been placed in the Startup folder of the Start Menu and startup items that have been written to the registry.\n\n(https://4sorcero.s3.amazonaws.com/byteback/core_2/fig_core_2_215b.png)\nSystem Configuration Utility→Startup tab (Windows 7).

TROUBLESHOOTING TIPS FOR WINDOWS SYSTEM ISSUES\n\nThis section discusses some typical Windows error messages and conditions.\n\nSLOW SYSTEM PERFORMANCE\nSlow system performance can have many causes. Use Task Manager to determine if  any resources are at 90-100% utilization and then note which process is most active. You may need to identify a particular Windows service running within a svchost.exe process (use the PID). Windows Update/Installer, the Superfetch/Prefetch caching engine, and Windows Defender (or third-party security software) are often the culprits.\n\n1. Wait for these processes to complete—if there is a mix of CPU, memory, and disk activity, then the process is probably operating normally, if slowly. If there is no disk activity or conversely if disk activity does not drop from 100%, the process could have stalled.\n\n2. If the process or system continues to be unresponsive, you can either restart the service or kill the task process,\n\n3. If killing the process doesn't restore system performance, try restarting the computer (reboot). The problem could be transitory and might not reoccur.\n\n4. If the service or process becomes unresponsive again after restarting, disable it and check with the software vendor for any known problems.\n\nIf you can't identify any overutilization, consider the following troubleshooting techniques and solutions:\n\n• Apply updates—check for any missing Windows and application updates and install the latest drivers for hardware devices.\n\n• Defragment the hard drive—running defrag regularly on a Hard Disk Drive (HDD) improves file I/O by putting files into contiguous clusters. Also make sure there is sufficient free disk space.\n\n• Power management issues—if the user has been closing sessions using sleep or hibernate, try restarting the computer. Verify that the system is not operating in a power-saving mode (CPU throttling).\n\n• Check for underpowered components—check resource utilization using Task Manager, Resource Monitor, or (for more extended periods) Performance Monitor. if CPU, system memory, disk, or network resources are continually stretched then the system will have to be upgraded.\n\n• Disable application startup—use the System Configuration Utility (ns conf i g) or Task Manager to prevent unnecessary services and programs from running at startup. If you need to run the services, consider setting them to delayed startup or manual startup to avoid slowing down boot times too much.\n\n• Disable Windows services/applications—if a service is not required and is causing problems, you can set it to Disabled to prevent it from being started. Note that some security-critical services (such as Windows Update) can be re-enabled automatically by the OS.\n\n• Security scan—scan the computer for viruses and other malware.\n\n• Check the configuration of anti-virus software—while necessary to keep users as safe as possible from malware, A-V software can have a very harmful effect on performance. Try disabling scanning temporarily to test whether performance improves. Make sure the software is configured to exclude Windows system files it shouldn't scan and configure any exceptions for software applications recommended by the vendor. These typically include database files and the image files used for virtual hard disks.\n\nSERVICE FAILS TO START\nIf you see a message such as One or more services failed to start during the Windows load sequence, check Event Viewer and/or the Services snap-in to identify which service has failed. Troubleshooting services can be complex, but bear the following general advice in mind:\n\n• Try to start the service manually—as most computers run a lot of services at startup, some can sometimes become "stuck." If a service is not required "immediately," it may help to set it to delayed start.\n\n• Services depend on account permissions to run—make sure that the service has sufficient privileges. Check that the service is associated with a valid user or system account and that the password configured for the account is correct.\n\n• Some services depend on other services to run—verify that disabling one service has not inadvertently affected others.\n\n• If a core Windows service is affected, check system files and scan the disk for errors and malware.\n\n• If an application service is affected, try reinstalling the application.\n\n• You may be able to use regsvr32 to re-register the software component (Dynamic Link Library [DLL]) that the service relies upon. in 64-bit versions of Windows, there are two versions of regsvr32. The 64-bit version (located in %SystemRoot%\System32\regsvr32.exe) is called by default and used with 64-bit DLLs, The 32-bit version is in %SystemRoot%\SysWOWE64\regsvr32, Run this version to re-register 32-bit DLLs.\n\n• Check whether the service is supposed to run—faulty software uninstall routines can leave “orphan” registry entries and startup shortcuts. Use the System Configuration Utility (msconfig) or Registry Editor (regedit) to look for orphaned items.\ntag: C2 L3 TC

TROUBLESHOOTING TIPS FOR APPLICATION ISSUES\n\nAs well as system-wide issues, some errors may be isolated to a particular application or file type.\n\nAPPLICATION CRASHES\nIf an application crashes, the first priority is to try to preserve any data that was being processed. Users should be trained to save regularly, but modern suites such as Microsoft Office are configured to save recovery files regularly, minimizing the chance of data loss.\n\nTry to give the process time to become responsive again and try to establish if you néed to try to recover data from temporary files or folders. When you have done all you can to preserve data, kill the task process. If the application crashes continually, check the event logs for any possible causes. Try to identify whether the cause lies in processing a particular data file or not.\n\nIf you cannot identify a specific cause of a problem, the generic solution to this type of problem is to uninstall then reinstall. Sometimes the Windows installer fails to remove every file and registry setting; if this is the case, then following manual uninstall instructions might help.\n\nAn uninstall followed by a reinstall can be a lengthy process. Many installers offer a Repair option (accessed via Programs and Features).\n\nPRINTING ISSUES\nPrinting issues can involve the printer hardware, network connectivity, or Windows settings. If you can discount hardware and network problems, make the following checks in Windows:\n\n1. Use the printer's property dialog box to try printing a test page. If this is successful, there must be an application or file-specific problem.\n\n2. Open the print queue and check for stalled print jobs.\n\n3. Restart the print spooler service.\n\n4. Check for any driver updates or known issues.\n\n5. Check permissions configured on the printer.\n\n6. Check for disk problems on the partition hosting the spool folder.\ntag: C2 L3 TC

BLUE SCREENS AND SPONTANEOUS SHUTDOWNS\n\nA Blue Screen of Death (BSoD) displays a Windows STOP error. A STOP error is one that causes Windows to halt. STOP errors can occur when Windows loads or while it is running. Most BSoDs, especially those that occur during startup, are caused by faulty hardware or hardware drivers.\n\n• Use System Restore, or (if you can boot to Safe Mode), Rollback Driver to restore the system to a working state.\n\n• Remove a recently added hardware device or uninstall a recently installed program.\n\n• Check seating of hardware components and cables,\n\n• Run hardware diagnostics, chkdsk, and scan for malware.\n\n• Make a note of the stop error code (which will be in the form: Stop: 0x0...) and search the Microsoft Knowledge Base (https://support.microsoft.com/search) for known fixes and troubleshooting tips. The various newsgroups accessible from this site offer another valuable source of assistance.\n\n(https://4sorcero.s3.amazonaws.com/byteback/core_2/fig_core_2_219.png)\nBlue Screen (of Death or BSoD).

This option can also be set from Advanced System Properties-»Startup and Recovery Settings.\n\nIf a system halts without any sort of error message, there is likely to be a power problem or a problem with the CPU.\ntag: C2 L3 TC

TROUBLESHOOTING TIPS FOR FILE AND MEMORY CORRUPTION\n\nProblems with slow performance, application crashes, and blue screens could be caused by some sort of file corruption occurring on the disk or in system memory. You can use the following tools to verify the integrity of system files and memory hardware.\n\nSYSTEM FILE CHECKER\nWindows comes with a Windows Resource Protection mechanism to prevent damage to or malicious use of system files and registry keys and files.\n\nThe System File Checker utility (Sf C) provides a manual interface for verifying system files and restoring them from cache if they are found to be corrupt or damaged. System files (and shared program files) are maintained and version controlled in the WINSxS system folder. This means that the product media is not called upon, but the WINSxS folder can consume quite a lot of disk space.\n\nThe program can be used from a command line (as Administrator) in the following modes:\n\n• sfc /scannow—runs a scan immediately.\n• sfc /scanonce—schedules a scan when the computer is next restarted.\n• sfc /scanboot —schedules scans whenever the PC boots.\n\n(https://4sorcero.s3.amazonaws.com/byteback/core_2/fig_core_2_220.png)\nSystem File Checker utility. (Screenshot used with permission from Microsoft)\n\nWINDOWS MEMORY DIAGNOSTICS\nWindows includes a Windows Memory Diagnostics tool to test memory chips for errors. You can either run the tool from Administrative Tools or boot to Windows Preinstallation/Recovery Environment and select Windows Memory Diagnostic. Select Restart now and check for problems. The computer will restart and run the test. Press F1 if you want to configure test options.\n\nIf errors are found, first check that all the memory modules are correctly seated, Remove all the memory modules but one and retest. You should be able to identify the faulty board by a process of elimination. If a known-good board is reported faulty, the problem is likely to lie in the motherboard.\n\n(https://4sorcero.s3.amazonaws.com/byteback/core_2/fig_core_2_221.png)\nWindows Memory Diagnostics. (Screenshot used with permission from Microsoft.)\n\nTROUBLESHOOTING TIPS FOR BOOT PROBLEMS\n\nAssuming there is no underlying hardware issue, the general technique for troubleshooting boot problems is to determine the failure point, and therefore the missing or corrupt file. This can then be replaced, either from the source files or using some sort of recovery disk.\n\nBOOT PROCESS\nWhen a computer starts, the firmware runs a Power On Self Test (POST) to verify that the system components are present and functioning correctly. It then identifies a boot device and passes control to the operating system's boot loader process.\n\nWith a legacy BIOS, the firmware scans the disk identified as the boot device and reads the Master Boot Record (MBR) in the first sector of the disk. The MBR identifies the boot sector or Volume Boot Record (VBR) for the partition marked as active. The VBR loads the boot manager, which for Windows is bootmgr.exe. The boot manager reads information from the Boot Configuration Data (BCD) file, which identifies operating systems installed on the computer. bootmgr and the BCD are normally installed to a hidden System Reserved partition. This partition can be formatted as either FAT32 or NTFS.\n\nAssuming there is only a single Windows installation, the boot manager loads the Windows boot loader winload.exe in the system root folder\n\nNote: If there is more than one OS installation, the boot manager shows a boot menu allowing the user to select the installation to boot.\n\nwinload then continues the Windows boot process by loading the kernel (ntoskrnl.exe), the Hardware Abstraction Layer (hal.dll), and boot device drivers.\n\nControl is then passed to the kernel, which initializes and starts loading the required processes. When complete, the winlogon process waits for the user to authenticate.\n\nWith an EFI boot, the initial part of the boot process is different. Following POST, the firmware reads the GUID Partition Table (GPT) on the boot device.  The GPT identifies the EFl System Partition, which is always formatted with FAT. The EFI system partition contains the bootmgr.efi boot manager and the BCD. In point-of-fact, Windows uses its own implementation of the boot manager called bootmgfw.efi (bootmgr.efi is configured to time out quickly and bootmgfw.efi loads instead). Each Windows installation has a subfolder under \EFI\Microsoft\ that contains a BCD and bootmgtw.efi.\n\nbootmgfw.efi reads the BCD to identify whether to show a boot menu and for the location of winload.efi. From this point, the Windows boot loader continues the boot process by loading the kernel, as described previously.\n\nFAILURE TO BOOT/INVALID BOOT DISK\nIf the system firmware returns an error message such as No boot device found or invalid boot disk, then the system has completely failed to boot. The most common cause of this error used to be leaving a floppy disk in the drive on a restart. A modern cause is for the system firmware to be set to use USB for boot. Check for any removable disks and change the boot device priority/boot order if necessary. If this message occurs when booting from a hard disk or SSD, check the connections to the drive. If the error is transitory (for example, if the message occurs a few times then the PC starts to boot OK), it could be a sign that the hard disk is failing. On an older system, it could be that the system firmware is having trouble detecting the drive.\n\nNO OS FOUND\nAn OS missing type message can appear when a disk drive is identified as the boot device but does not report the location of the OS loader. This could indicate a faulty disk, so try running disk diagnostics (if available) then use a recovery option to run chkdsk.\n\nIf the disk cannot be detected, enter system setup and try modifying settings (or even resetting the default settings). If the disk’s presence is reported by the system firmware but Windows still will not boot, use a startup repair tool to open a recovery mode command prompt and use the boot rec tool to try to repair the drive's boot information.\n\n1. Enter bootrec /fixmbr to attempt repair of the MBR.\n\n2. Enter bootrec /fixboot to attempt repair of the boot sector.\n\n3. Enter bootrec /rebuildbcd to add missing Windows installations to the Boot Configuration Database (BCD).\n\nYou could also use diskpart to ensure that the system partition is marked as active and that no other partitions have been marked as active.\n\nGRAPHICAL INTERFACE FAILS TO LOAD/BLACK SCREEN\nIf Windows appears to boot but does not display the logon dialog box or does not load the desktop following logon, the likely causes are malware infection or corruption of drivers or other system files. if the system will boot to a GUI in Safe Mode, then replace the graphics adapter driver. If the system will not boot to a GUI at all, then the Windows installation will probably have to be repaired or recovered from backup. It is also possible that the boot configuration has been changed through msconfig and just needs to be set back.\n\nWindows is also sporadically prone to black screen issues, where nothing appears on the screen. This will often occur during update installs, where the best course of action is to give the system time to complete the update. Look for signs of continuing disk activity and spinning dots appearing on the screen. If the system does not recover from a black screen, then try searching for any currently known issues on support and troubleshooting sites (https://support.microsoft.com/en-ph/help/14106/windows-10-troubleshoot-black-screen-problems). You can use the key sequence Windows+Ctrl Shift+B to test whether the system is responsive. There should be a beep and the display may reinitialize.\n\nIf the problem occurs frequently, use sfc to verify system file integrity and check video drivers.\n\nSLOW BOOT/SLOW PROFILE LOAD\nIf Windows does boot, but only very slowly, you need to try to identify what is happening to slow the process down. You can enable verbose status messages during the Windows load sequence by configuring a system policy or applying a registry setting. In Windows 7, enable Verbose vs normal status messages or in Windows 8/10, enable Display highly detailed status messages.\n\nDelays affecting the system prior to logon are caused by loading drivers and services. Quite often the culprit will be some type of network service or configuration not working optimally, but there could be some sort of file corruption, too.\n\nIf the system is slow to load the desktop following logon, the issue could be a corrupt user profile. The registry settings file ntuser.dat is particularly prone to this. Rebuilding a local user profile means creating a new account and then copying files, from the old, corrupt profile to the new one, but excluding the following files:\n\n• Ntuser.dat\n• Ntuser.dat.log\n• Ntuser.ini\ntag: C2 L3 TC

SAFE BOOT\n\nSafe Mode loads only basic drivers and services required to start the system. This is a useful troubleshooting mode as it isolates reliability or performance problems to add-in drivers or application services and rules out having to fully reinstall Windows. It may also be a means of running analysis and recovery tools, such as chkdsk, System Restore, or anti-virus utilities.\n\nSafe Mode defaults to SVGA resolution (800x600). Higher resolutions may be available if the basic driver supports them.\n\nYou can boot to Safe Mode using the System Configuration utility, but this option is only useful if you can sign in to Windows anyway. if you cannot sign in, there are different startup repair options for Windows 7 and Windows 8/10.\n\nWINDOWS 7 ADVANCED BOOT OPTIONS\nIn Windows 7, the Advanced Boot Options menu allows the selection of different startup modes for troubleshooting. To show the menu, press F8 during startup—after the memory count; try tapping repeatedly if the menu doesn't get displayed. \n\n(https://4sorcero.s3.amazonaws.com/byteback/core_2/fig_core_2_224.png)\nAdvanced Boot Options in Windows 7. (Screenshot used with permission from Microsoft)\n\nApart from Safe Mode, some of the other options include:\n\n• Safe Mode with Networking—includes drivers and services required to access the network.\n\n• Safe Mode with Command Prompt—runs the command shell rather than Explorer.\n\n• Last Known Good—boots with the last registry configuration that was used to log on successfully.\n\nWINDOWS 8/10 STARTUP SETTINGS\nIn Windows 8 and Windows 10, the boot process happens too quickly to use F8. You can hold the Shift key when selecting the Restart option from the Power menu to display troubleshooting options—note that you don’t have to sign in to view the power menu.\n\n(https://4sorcero.s3.amazonaws.com/byteback/core_2/fig_core_2_225a .png)\nWindows 20 Startup options.

WinRE AND STARTUP REPAIR\n\nIf you cannot boot the computer from the local installation, you can try booting from the product media, a repair disk, or a recovery partition. You may have to access BIOS or UEFI setup to configure the boot device to the recovery media.\n\nIf you don't have the product media, you can make a system repair disk from Windows using the recdisc tool. Obviously, you need to have done this before the computer starts failing to boot or create one using a working Windows installation.\n\nOnce in the recovery environment, if the boot files are damaged, you can use the Startup Repair option to try to fix them. You can also launch System Restore or restore from an image backup from here. The last two options are to run a memory diagnostic and to drop into the Recovery Environment command prompt, where you could run startup recovery commands such as diskpart, sfc, chkdsk, bootrec, bededit, or regedit manually.\n\n(https://4sorcero.s3.amazonaws.com/byteback/core_2/fig_core_2_226.png)\nWindows 7 System Recovery Options. (Screenshot used with permission from Microsoft.)\n\nNote: The Recovery Environment is an extended version of the Preinstallation Environment (PE) used to set up Windows in the first place.\n\nIn Windows 8/10, as well as recdisc, you can use the Recovery Media Creator to create a USB-based repair disk and optionally include any recovery partition from the local disk. Boot using the recovery media, then from the first Choose an option screen, select Troubleshoot. From the next screen, select Advanced options.\n\nAdvanced options let you run system restore, reinstall from a system image backup, run the automated startup repair tool, or drop to a command prompt. On a UEFI- based install, there is also an option to reboot to the system firmware setup program. In Windows 10, you may also be able to use See more recovery options to revert to a previous build, following a feature update.\n \n(https://4sorcero.s3.amazonaws.com/byteback/core_2/fig_core_2_227.png)\nWindows 10 Startup Troubleshooting→Advanced options.

SYSTEM RESTORE\n\nSystem Restore allows you to roll back from system configuration changes. System Restore allows for multiple restore points to be maintained (some are created automatically) and to roll back from changes to the whole registry and reverse program installations and updates.\n\nNote: System Restore does not restore (or delete) user data files. Files stored in users’ Documents folders will be preserved. Also, the contents of settings folders such as Recent and Favorite links and Temporary Internet Files will not be rolled back.\n\nCONFIGURING SYSTEM PROTECTION\nThe System Protection tab (opened via the System Properties applet) lets you select which disk{s) to enable for system restore and configure how much disk capacity is used. The disk must be formatted with NTFS, have a minimum of 300 MB free space, and be over 1 GB in size.\n\nRestore points are created automatically in response to application and update installs. They are also created periodically by the Scheduled Tasks applet. Windows will try to create one when it detects the PC is idle if no other restore points have been created in the last 7 days. You can also create a restore point manually from this dialog box.\n\n(https://4sorcero.s3.amazonaws.com/byteback/core_2/fig_core_2_228a.png)\nConfiguring System Protection in Windows 10. (Screenshot used with permission from Microsoft.)\n\nUSING SYSTEM RESTORE\nTo restore the system, open the System Restore tool (rstrui), or run it by booting from the product disk or selecting the Repair Your Computer from the Advanced Options boot menu (Windows 7) or the Startup Recovery tools in Windows 8/10.\n\n(https://4sorcero.s3.amazonaws.com/byteback/core_2/fig_core_2_228b.png)\nUsing System Restore to apply a previous system configuration. (Screenshot used with permission from Microsoft)\n\nNote: System Restore does not usually reset passwords (that is, passwords will remain as they were before you ran the restore tool), but System Restore does reset passwords to what they were at the time the restore point was created if you run it from the product disk. This can be used to recover from a forgotten administrator password (refer to (https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/940765/how-to-use-system-restore-to-log-on-to-windows-7-or-windows-vista-when) for more details)\n\nROLL BACK UPDATES\nIf an update causes problems, you can try to uninstall it. You might be able to use System Restore to do this. Otherwise, open the Programs and Features applet and click View installed updates.

A new driver may not work properly because it has not been fully tested or it may not work on your particular system. Driver roll back can recover a system speedily and easily where this has occurred. You can use Device Manager to revert to the previous driver. Right-click the device and select Properties. Click the Driver tab then click the Roll Back Driver button.\n\n(https://4sorcero.s3.amazonaws.com/byteback/core_2/fig_core_2_230.png)\nUsing driver rollback via Device Manager.

SYSTEM REPAIR AND REINSTALL\n\nIf System Restore or Startup Repair do not work and you cannot boot to a log on, try to boot in Safe Mode. If this works, you should then be able to pinpoint the problem to a particular driver or service. Safe Mode loads Windows with a minimal set of drivers and services, so if this works it tells you that something is going wrong later on in the OS load. If the computer will not boot at all, you will have to resort to a system repair tool or possibly a reinstall option and restore from data backup (presuming you have made one). The various versions of Windows use different system recovery tools and backup processes.\n\nCREATING AND USING A RECOVERY IMAGE\nYou can make a complete backup of the system configuration and data files. This is called an image. This method is simple, but you do need a backup device with large capacity. The best option is usually a removable hard drive. The best compression ratio you can hope for is 2:1—so a 20 GB system will create a 10 GB image—but if the system contains a lot of files that are already heavily compressed, the ratio could be a lot lower. You do have to keep the image up-to-date or make a separate data backup.\n\nYou create a system image using the Backup and Restore applet in Control Panel Click the Create a system image link in the Tasks pane. Select a backup device and give the image a suitable name.\n\nTo recover the system using the backup image, use the Advanced Boot Option or the System Image Recovery option off a repair disk or recovery environment.\n\nREINSTALLING WINDOWS\nIf you do not have an up-to-date image, the last option is to reinstall Windows. You can try reinstalling Windows 7 over the top of an existing installation. This will preserve the previous data in a Windows.old folder and might allow you to recover data files, if you do not have a data backup. You will need to reinstall software applications and reconfigure user accounts and settings.\n\nIn Windows 8 and Windows 10, there is a reset option to try to repair the installation. This recopies the system files and reverts all PC settings to the default, but can preserve user personalization settings, data files, and apps installed via Windows Store. Desktop applications are removed.\n\nRestart to the recovery environment (or use a repair disk). From the first Choose an option screen, select Troubleshoot. Select Reset this PC.\n\n(https://4sorcero.s3.amazonaws.com/byteback/core_2/fig_core_2_231a.png)\nWindows 20 startup recovery.
