Lesson 9\nSupporting and Troubleshooting Mobile Devices\n\nLESSON INTRODUCTION\nMobile devices are everywhere today. Because of their portability and powerful computing capabilities, they are prominent in most workplaces. So, as a certified CompTIA” A+? technician, you will be expected to configure, maintain, and troubleshoot mobile computing devices. With the proper information and the right skills, you will be ready to support these devices as efficiently as you support their desktop counterparts.\n\nLESSON OBJECTIVES\nIn this lesson, you will:\n\n• Secure mobile devices.\n\n• Troubleshoot mobile device issues.\ntag: C2 L9

Topic A\nSecure Mobile Devices\n\nEXAM OBJECTIVES COVERED\n1002-2.8 Given a scenario, implement methods for securing mobile devices.\n\nMobile devices can be used for multiple functions within the professional workplace. Knowing that, you must be able to provide basic level support to your users, including configuring security settings.\ntag: C2 L9 TA

POPULAR SECURITY CONTROLS FOR MOBILE DEVICES\n\nIt is critical that the organization's mobile device security practices be specified via policies procedures, and training. Although you always want your practices specified Particularly important with respect to mobile devices, because these devices tend to be forgotten or overlooked. They don't reside, or “live,” in the workplace in the same way as, for example, a desktop computer, and they won't necessarily be there when virus databases are being updated, patches are being installed, files are backed up, and so on. Procedural and technical controls to manage these mobile devices mitigate the risk that they may introduce vulnerabilities in the company’s network security.\n\nThere are two principal challenges when it comes to mobile device security: portability and capacity:\n\n• Portability—devices that are portable are easy to lose or to steal or to sneak into somewhere they should not be allowed.\n\n• Capacity—while great for consumers, the capacity and ease of portability of flash media, removable hard drives, smartphones, and tablets is a big problem for information security. A typical removable hard drive or Network Attached Storage (NAS) device or even a smartphone can copy down the contents of a workstation or even a server in a few minutes. Because they use USB or network ports, it is difficult to prevent the attachment of such devices.\n\nThe problems, therefore, surround the fact that because of their portability and capacity, mobile devices can be both targets of attack and the means by which an attack can be accomplished. You have to protect the data on your mobile devices from being compromised, and you have to protect the data in any of your systems from being removed by mobile devices.\n\nNote: One of the most important steps you can take to maintain security of mobile devices is to not leave the devices unattended.\ntag: C2 L9 TA

MOBILE DEVICE ACCESS CONTROL\n\nThe majority of smartphones and tablets are single-user devices. Access control can be implemented by configuring a password or PIN and screen lock. iOS does not support multiple user accounts at all. Later versions of Android support multiple user accounts on both tablets and smartphones.\n\nSCREEN LOCKS AND BIOMETRIC AUTHENTICATION\nIf an attacker is able to gain access to a smartphone or tablet, they can obtain a huge amount of information and the tools with which to launch further attacks. Apart from confidential data files that might be stored on the device, it is highly likely that the user has cached passwords for services such as email or remote access VPN and websites. In addition to this, access to contacts and message history (SMS, text messaging, email, and IM) greatly assists social engineering attacks.\n\nConsequently, it is imperative that data stored on the device be encrypted and access to the device protected by a screen lock.\n\nConfiguring a screen lock means that a password/passcode (or at the very least a PIN) is required to use the device. There are also "join-the-dots" pattern locks, which are also referred as swipe locks.\n\n[file:///fig-473.png]\nConflguring screen lock options in i0S (left) and Android (right).\n\nNote: Pattern passcodes have several drawbacks. The smudge pattern may remain visible on the surface, making it much easier to guess or copy. Swipe patterns are also quite easy to observe over someone's shoulder\n\nAll but the cheapest device models now include a fingerprint sensor to provide a biometric authentication method. Apple refers to this feature as Touch ID. The user sets up a template fingerprint scan, which is converted to a unique hash and stored within a secure cache on the device (enrollment). To authenticate, the user touches the reader and the device re-computes the hash; if it matches the stored value, then access is granted.\n\nAnother biometric mechanism is the face lock, with the hash being computed from a picture of the user's face rather than a scan of their fingerprint. This has the advantage of being able to use a standard device (the camera) rather than a special sensor. Apple refers to their system as Face ID.\n\n\nNote: Biometric methods tend to suffer from high error rats, including false negatives (where the sensor does not identify the scan as valid) and false positives (where the sensor validates a scan it should not have). A passcode is also configured as a backup authentication method.\n\nLOCKOUT POLICY AND REMOTE WIPING\nThe screen lock can also be configured with a lockout policy or (put another way) a policy to restrict failed login attempts. This means that if an incorrect passcode is entered, the device locks for a set period. This could be configured to escalate—so the first incorrect attempt locks the device for 30 seconds while the third locks it for 10 minutes, for instance. This deters attempts to guess the passcode.\n\nAnother option on some phones is the support for remote wipe or a kill switch. This means that if the handset is stolen, it can be set to the factory defaults, disabled, and/or cleared of any personal data. Some utilities may also be able to wipe any plug- in memory cards, too. The remote wipe could be triggered by a number of incorrect passcode attempts or by enterprise management software.  Other features include backing up data from the phone to a server first and displaying a"Lost/stolen phone—return to XX" message on the handset.\n\n[file:///fig-474.png]\nMost corporate messaging systems come with a Remote Wipe feature. allowing mail, calendar, and contacts information to be deleted from mobile devices.\n\nThe 0S vendors now often supply the same services, such as Apple's Activation Lock or Google's Device Protection.\n\nA thief can (in theory) prevent a remote wipe by ensuring the phone cannot connect to the network, then hacking the phone and disabling the security, but this requires some expertise. Even in those cases, services such as Activation Lock work in the device firmware, preventing restores or the disabling of location services.\ntag: C2 L9 TA

MOBILE DEVICE AND DATA RECOVERY\n\nIf a mobile device is lost or stolen, there are mechanisms to use to try to effect its recovery and to prevent any misuse or loss of data stored on the device.\n\nGPS, GEOTRACKING, AND LOCATOR APPLICATIONS\nMost smartphones and many tablets are now fitted with Global Positioning System (GPS) receivers. GPS is a means of determining a receiver's position on the Earth based on information received from GPS satellites. The receiver must have line-of-sight to the GPS satellites. As GPS requires line-of-sight, it does not work indoors. Indoor Positioning Systems (IPS) work out a device's location by triangulating its proximity to other radio sources, such as Wi-Fi access points or Bluetooth beacons.\n\nKnowing the device's position (geotracking) also allows app vendors and websites to offer location-specific services (relating to search or local weather, for instance) and (inevitably) advertising. You can use Location Services settings to determine how Visible your phone is to these services.\n\nAs well as supporting maps and turn-by-turn instructions, Location Services can be used for security to locate a lost or stolen device. Such Find My Phone or locator applications are now a standard service for all the major mobile OSes. Once set up, the location of the phone (as long as it is powered on) can be tracked from any web browser.\n\n[file:///fig-475.png]\nYou can use the iCloud and Find My Phone apps to locate an iOS device and remotely lock or wipe it (or send the current holder a polite message to please return it ASAP).\n\nNote: if « mobile device has a locator app installed and the device is lost or stolen, some apps allow the user to remotely enable features in the app. One feature that can be quite useful is enabling the camera on the phone. t has been reported that sometimes the thief has been captured using the photos taken in this manner.\n\nFULL DEVICE ENCRYPTION\nAll but the earliest versions of mobile device OSes for smartphones and tablets provide full device encryption. The purpose of device encryption is to prevent anyone in possession of the device being able to circumvent the mobile OS's access controls and read the raw data stored on the flash memory components. If that raw data is encrypted (and the attacker cannot retrieve the encryption key from the device), then the information remains inaccessible.\n\nIn iOS, there are various levels of encryption.\n\n• All user data on the device is always encrypted but the key is stored on the device. This is primarily used as a means of wiping the device. The OS just needs to delete the key to make the data inaccessible rather than wiping each storage location.\n\n• Email data and any apps using the Data Protection option are also encrypted using a key derived from the user's passcode. This provides security for data in the event that the device is stolen. Not all user data is encrypted; contacts, SMS messages, and pictures are not, for example.\n\nIn iOS, Data Protection encryption is enabled automatically when configuring a password lock on the device.\n\nIn Android, encryption is enabled via Settings→Security. Android uses full-disk encryption with a passcode-derived key. When encryption is enabled, it can take some time to encrypt the device.\n\n[file:///fig-476.png]\nEncryption options in Android OS.\n\nNote: The encryption key is derived from the PIN or password. In order to generate a strong key, you should use a strong password. Of course, this makes accessing the device each time the screen locks more difficult.\n\nNote: With the release of Android Nougat, full device encryption is being deprecated in favor of file-level encryption.\n\nREMOTE BACKUP APPLICATIONS\nMost mobile OS devices are configured with a user account linked to the vendor's cloud services (iCloud for iOS, Google Sync for stock Android, and OneDrive for Microsoft). The user can then choose to automatically back up data, apps, and settings to the cloud. A user may choose to use a different backup provider (OneDrive on an Android phone, for instance) or a third-party provider, such as Dropbox.\n\nAs well as cloud services, a device can be backed up to a PC. For example, iOS supports making backups via the iTunes program. A third option is for Mobile Device Management (MDM) software to be configured to back up user devices automatically.\ntag: C2 L9 TA

MULTIFACTOR AUTHENTICATION AND AUTHENTICATOR APPLICATIONS\n\nAuthentication methods are stronger when they are combined, There are four main types of “factor” describing different authentication methods:\n\n• Something you know—such as a password or pass code or swipe pattern.\n\n• Something you are—such as your fingerprint or face.\n\n• Something you have—such as a unique digital token or smart card.\n\n• Somewhere you are—use of a device or service might be tied to your geolocation.\n\nMultifactor authentication means using two different methods. Requiring a user to enter a password and then a PIN is not multifactor.\n\nMobile device unlock methods are almost always single factor because no one wants to go through the bother of multifactor authentication every time the device is used. A user might configure two alternative methods of unlocking the device, such as configuring face lock and a pattern lock, but this is not multifactor authentication.\n\nMultifactor authentication is often used with online services. For example, when using a new device with a web service or app such as email or online storage, many vendors. encourage the use of 2-step verification. 2-step verification means that as well as a password for the service, you register a phone or alternative email address. When you use a new computer or device to access the service, the authenticator application sends a code in the form of a One Time Password (OTP) to your phone. You must then supply the account user name and password and the OTP code to authenticate. This reduces the risk that someone who has discovered your password could access your account, because the computer they are using is not one recognized by the service.\n\nNote: The OTP is computed in such a way that ican only be used once (and often has to be used within a limited time frame).\ntag: C2 L9 TA

MOBILE DEVICE POLICIES\n\nMobile Device Management (MDM) is a class of enterprise software designed to apply security policies to the use of smartphones and tablets in business networks. This software can be used to manage corporate-owned devices as well as Bring Your Own Device (BYOD). BYOD means allowing employees to use their private smartphones and tablet devices to access corporate data.\n\nA key feature of MDM is the ability to support multiple operating systems, such as i0S, Android, and the various iterations of Windows and Windows Mobile. A few MDM suites are OS-specific (such as Apple Configurator) but the major ones, such as AirWatch (www.air-watch.com), Symantec (www.symantec.com), and Citrix Endpoint Management (www.citrix.com), support multiple device vendors.\n\nPROFILING SECURITY REQUIREMENTS\nThe MDM software logs use of a device on the network and determines whether to allow it to connect or not, based on administrator-set parameters. This process can be described as onboarding.\n\nWhen the device is enrolled with the management software, it can be configured with policies to allow or restrict use of apps, corporate data, and built-in functions such as a video camera or microphone. Policies can also be set to ensure the device patch status is up-to-date, that anti-virus software is present and updated, and that a device firewall has been applied and configured correctly.\n\n[file:///fig-478.png]\nPolicy has disabled swipe, pattern, and PIN access, forcing use of a complex password.\n\nA company needs to create a profile of security requirements and policies to apply for different employees and different sites are areas within a site. For example, it might be more secure to disable the camera function of any smartphone while onsite but users might complain that they cannot use their phones for video calls. A sophisticated security system might be able to apply a more selective policy and disable the camera only when the device is within an area deemed high risk from a data confidentiality point-of-view. Some policies can be implemented with a technical solution; others require "soft" measures, such as training and disciplinary action.\n\nTRUSTED AND UNTRUSTED APP SOURCES\nA trusted app source is one that is managed by a service provider. The service provider authenticates and authorizes valid developers, issuing them with a certificate to use to sign their apps and warrant them as trusted. It may also analyze code submitted to ensure that it does not pose a security or privacy risk to its customers (or remove apps that are discovered to pose such a risk). It may apply other policies that developers must meet, such as not allowing apps with adult content or apps that duplicate the function of core OS apps.\n\nThe mobile OS defaults to restricting app installations to the linked store (App Store for 10S and Play for Android). Most consumers are happy with this model but it does not work so well for enterprises. It might not be appropriate to deliver a custom corporate app via a public store, where anyone could download it.\n\nApple operates an enterprise developer program to solve this problem. The enterprise developer can install a profile with their security credentials along with the app. This is normally handled by an MDM suite. The user then chooses to trust the app via Settings→General→Profiles. It is also possible to sideload enterprise apps via iTunes and a desktop PC.\n\nThe Play store has a private channel option and Google runs an Android for Work program for enterprise developers.\n\nAndroid allows for selection of different stores and installation of untrusted apps from any third party, if the user chooses the third party or unknown sources option. This allows a greater degree of customization but also makes the device wiinerable to attacks. With unknown sources enabled, untrusted apps can be downloaded from a website and installed using the apk file format.\n\n[file:///fig-479.png]\nDisabling access to unknown sources.\ntag: C2 L9 TA

MOBILE DEVICE SECURITY SOFTWARE\n\nMobile devices can use the same classes of security software as PCs and laptops to harden against malware, software exploits, or network exploits.\n\nANTI-VIRUS/ANTI-MALWARE AND FIREWALLS\nModern smartphones are computers in their own right and as such are vulnerable to software exploits as well as being targets of malware and viruses, especially if an untrusted app source has been configured, Anti-virus apps have become popular in the Android app market especially after some publicized cases of viral infection on Android devices. Some mobile anti-virus software scans only installed apps and ignores plug-in flash memory cards. There is also a problem with the limited user base and the emerging natures of mobile OS threats and vulnerabilities. This makes it difficult to create pattern databases of known threats and use heuristics (machine learning) to identify new threats.\n\nAnother class of security software is the app scanner. These are designed to monitor the permissions allocated to apps and how they are using (or abusing) them. There are also firewall apps for mobile devices. These can be used to monitor app activity and prevent connections to particular ports or IP addresses. One issue for firewalls is that they must be able to control other apps and therefore logically work at a higher permission level (root). Installing an app with root access is challenging, however. "No-root" Firewalls work by creating a Virtual Private Network (VPN) and then controlling app access to the VPN.\n\nApple has traditionally been relaxed about the need for third-party security solutions, such as anti-virus or firewalls. Consequently, there are few iOS security apps.\n\nPATCHING/OS UPDATES\nKeeping a mobile OS and its apps up-to-date with patches (and ideally new OS versions) is as critical as it is for a desktop computer. The install base of iOSis generally better at applying updates because of the consistent hardware and software platform. Updates for iOS are notified by an alert on wake and delivered via Settings→General→Software Update. App updates are indicated via red notifications on the app icon and delivered via the Updates page in the app store.\n\nAndroid patches are more reliant on the device vendor as they have to deliver the patch for their own "flavor" of Android. Support for new OS versions can also be mixed. Android uses the notification shade to deliver updates. You can also go to Settings→About→System updates.\ntag: C2 L9 TA

Topic B\nTroubleshoot Mobile Device Issues\n \n\nEXAM OBJECTIVES COVERED\n1002-3.4 Given a senario, troubeshoot mobile OS and application issues.\n1002-3.5 Given a scenario, troubleshoot mobile OS and application security issues.\n\nYou can use similar troubleshooting techniques as for PCs and laptops to resolve issues on mobile device operating systems and applications. One difference is that apps, operating system, and hardware are tightly integrated in mobile devices such as smartphones and tablets. You may need to troubleshoot all three components in order to determine which one is actually causing the issue.\ntag: C2 L9 TB

MOBILE OS TROUBLESHOOTING TOOLS\n\nWhen you are troubleshooting a mobile OS, you need to know how to find configuration options and perform different types of device resets.\n\nADJUSTING SETTINGS\nIn iOS, configuration settings are stored under the Settings app. There are settings for both the core OS and for individual apps. In Android, the Settings app can be added to the home screen or accessed via the Cog icon in the notification shade.\n\nCLOSING RUNNING APPS\nA mobile OS performs sophisticated memory management to be able to run multiple applications while allowing each app to have sufficient resources and preventing an app from consuming excessive amounts of power and draining the battery. The memory management routines shift apps between foreground (in active use), background (potentially accessing the network and other resources), and suspended (not using any resources).\n\nBoth iOS and Android show a “multitasking” list of apps that the user has opened. This multitasking list doesn’t actually mean that the app is loaded into memory, however. In Android, you can remove an app from the list by pressing the multitasking button (a square or rectangle) then swiping the app left or right off the screen. Doing this won't have any impact on performance.\n\nIf an app is actually unresponsive, it can be closed via the force stop option.\n\n• In Android, open Settings—Apps. Tap an app, then select the Force Stop option to close it or the Disable option to make it unavailable.\n\n• In iOS, clearing an app from the multitasking list also force stops it. Double tap the Home button then swipe the app up off the screen.\n\n[file:///fig-483.png]\nIn Android, tap the multitasking button (bottom-right to view open apps, then swipe eft or right to remove them; use the Force Stop option in app settings to fully close an app.\n\nUNINSTALL/REINSTALL APPS\nAnother stock response to an app issue is to uninstall then reinstall it.\n\n• To uninstall an iOS app, tap-and-hold it until it wiggles, then press the X icon and confirm by pressing Delete. You cannot uninstall default apps. To return the screen to normal, press the Home button. You can also delete apps from Settings or from iTunes.\n\n• In Android, use Settings-» Apps to uninstall (completely remove) or disable (prevent from running) apps. You can also long:press an icon on the home screen then drag it to the Uninstall icon (dragging it to Remove just hides the app icon).\n\nApps can be reinstalled via the store (without having to pay for them again).\n\nREBOOTING A MOBILE DEVICE\nJust as turning it off and on again is the tried and trusted method of computer, a reboot can resolve many software-related issues on a mobile device. Users generally leave their mobile devices in a sleep state. Powering the device off closes all applications and clears any data from RAM. Data and settings stored in the device are not affected. This kind of soft reset is usually effective in restoring unresponsive or frozen systems and is one of the first things to try when faced with a malfunctioning app or slow performance. It is also used after the installation of some apps.\n\n• On iOS, holding the Sleep/Wake button down for a few seconds brings up a menu prompting the user to swipe so the device can be shut down. When you are troubleshooting, leave the device powered off for a minute, and then restart by holding the Sleep button again. If the touchscreen is unresponsive, you can perform a forced restart by pressing the Sleep/Wake and Home buttons for 10 seconds. The screen will go black then the device will restart. When performing a forced restart, unsaved data in current use may be lost.\n\n• On Android, to power off, hold the Power button for a few seconds to bring up the Power Off prompt. If the touchscreen is unresponsive, a forced restart can often be performed by holding the Power button for 10 seconds, though some Android devices use a different key combination for this. You can also boot an Android device to Safe Mode by tap-and-holding the Power Off message. Safe Mode disables third-party apps, but leaves core services running.\n\nFACTORY DEFAULT RESET\nA factory default reset removes all user data, apps, and settings. The device will either have to be manually reconfigured with a new user account and apps reloaded, or restored from a backup configuration. When you are performing a factory reset, ensure that the device has a full battery charge or is connected to an external power source.\n\n• To factory reset an iOS device, connect it to a PC or Mac running iTunes. You can use the Update button on the device's summary page to try to reinstall iOS without removing user data. f this does not work, use the Restore button to perform a factory reset. If the Update or Restore buttons are not available, use the force soft restart method described earlier while the device is connected to iTunes.\n\n• For Android, you should check for specific instructions for each particular device. On stock Android, you can initiate a reset from the Backup and Reset section of Settings. If the device will not boot normally, you can enter recovery mode using some combination of the power and volume buttons.\n\nNote: Some vendors may use the term "hard reset” to mean a factory reset.\n\nNote: You might be required to signin immediately fter performing a factory restore to protect against theft of the device or your account information. Make sure you have the account credentials available and do not attempt a factory reset within 72 hours of changing your account password.\ntag: C2 L9 TB

GUIDELINES FOR USING MOBILE TROUBLESHOOTING TOOLS\n\nHere are some guidelines to help you use mobile troubleshooting tools.\n\nUSE MOBILE TROUBLESHOOTING TOOLS\nConsider these guidelines for using mobile troubleshooting tools:\n\n• Adjust settings for the core OS and for apps.\n\n• Close running apps that are consuming too much power and draining the battery or those that are unresponsive.\n\n• Uninstall apps that are no longer needed or reinstall apps after replacing a device or after previously uninstalling an app.\n\n• Trya soft reset for devices that are frozen or unresponsive. If that doesn’t work, use a forced restart.\n\n• Perform a factory default reset when reissuing the mobile device to another user or preparing it for disposal.\ntag: C2 L9 TB

MOBILE OS ISSUE TROUBLESHOOTING\n\nLike any other computer, mobile devices can have their own issues that need diagnosing and fixing.\n\nDIM DISPLAY\nOne of the common issues is a dim display. This usually happens when the user has (and disabled automatic light adjustment) or the phone is set to conserve power by auto dimming the light. To adjust, open Display settings and select the automatic brightness option or adjust the slider.\n\n[file:///fig-485.png]\nScreen Brightness adjustment.\n\nIt is also worth checking for third-party power management apps or the use of a battery-saver mode or profile that automatically dims the backlight to conserve power.\n\nTOUCHSCREEN UNRESPONSIVE OR INACCURATE\nIf the touchscreen is unresponsive or does not register touches at the correct coordinates, first check for obvious hardware issues (dirt, grease, or cracks). If a screen protector is fitted, check that it is securely adhered to the surface and that there are no bubbles or lifts.\n\nIf you can rule out simple hardware causes, unresponsive touch input can be an indication of resources being inadequate (too many open apps) or badly written apps that hog memory or other resources. A soft reset will usually fix the problem in the short term. If the problem is persistent, either try to identify whether the problem is, linked to running a particular app or try freeing space by removing data or apps. Windows devices and some versions of Android support re-calibration utilities, but if you cannot identify another cause, then you are likely to have to look at warranty repair.\n\nEXTERNAL MONITOR ISSUES\nScreen sharing can be enabled via an adapter cable. If there is a problem, you should try to rule out a bad cable first.\n\nMobiles can also connect to wireless displays or reception dongles. The principal issue here is that the various wireless standards (Miracast/Wi-Fi Direct, Intel WiDi, Apple AirPlay, Google Chromecast, and Amazon Fire TV) are not interoperable so you need to ensure both the broadcast and reception devices are using the same technology. You also need to rule out the usual potential sources of wireless interference.\n\nNote: Miracast is based on Wi-Fi Direct, which is less proprietary than the other standards but there are lots of interoperability problems between "Miracast-compatible" devices. The TV vendors all have different names for it (SmartShare, Screen Mirroring, Display Mirroring, and so on).\n\nSOUND ISSUES\nIf no sound is playing from the device speakers, first check that the volume controls are not turned all the way down and that the mute switch is not activated. Next verify that the device is not in a silent/no interruptions mode. If the problem is restricted to a particular app, check whether it has its own volume controls. If you cannot identify a software issue, check that the device is not configured to use external speakers. These could be connected via a cable or by Bluetooth.\n\nOVERHEATING\nDevices have protective circuitry that will initiate a shut down if the internal temperature is at the maximum safe limit.\n\nHandheld devices use passive cooling and so can become quite warm when used intensively, Also make sure that the device is not left sitting in direct sunlight. Ifa handheld device becomes unusually hot, suspect a problem with the battery. There may be a utility that you can use to access battery status information. You can also use an app to monitor the battery temperature and then compare that to the operating limits. Generally speaking, approaching 40°C is getting too warm.\n\n[file:///fig-486.png]\nCPU-Z app showing the device's battery status.\n\nIf a device overheats repeatedly, check for apps with consistently high CPU utilization, Ifthe device is a few years old, consider the possibility that the battery is failing, Monitor the device during charging cycles; if it overheats, then discontinue use and have it inspected at a repair center.\n\nNote: if you have any reason to suspect that a device is prone to overheating, do not leave it to charge unattended.\ntag: C2 L9 TB

GUIDELINES FOR TROUBLESHOOTING MOBILE OS ISSUES\n\nHere are some guidelines to help you troubleshoot mobile OS issues.\n\nTROUBLESHOOT MOBILE OS ISSUES\nConsider these guidelines as you troubleshoot the following mobile OS issues:\n\n• Dim display. Open the Display settings and adjust the automatic brightness option or adjust the brightness slider. Check for apps that dim the backlight to conserve power.\n\n• Unresponsive or inaccurate touchscreen. Check for issues with the screen, that any screen protectors are not damaged or incorrectly applied. Check that there are adequate resources available. Use a re-calibration utility if no other cause for the issue is found.\n\n• Issues with external monitor. Verify that the cable is good. Verify that a casting dongle (Google Chromecast, Miracast, AirPlay, Amazon Fire, etc) is configured correctly between the device and the mobile device.\n\n• Sound issues. Verify volume controls are set correctly. Verify silent mode is not enabled. Check volume controls within the app. Verify it is not configured to use external speakers through a cable or Bluetooth.\n\n• Overheating, Determine if the device is being used intensively. Use a battery monitor to view battery status information. Keep device away from direct sunlight or other heat sources.\ntag: C2 L9 TB

MOBILE APP ISSUE TROUBLESHOOTING\n\nAs noted previously, with a mobile device it can be difficult to identify when a problem might be caused by the hardware, the OS, or a particular app.\n\nAPPS NOT LOADING\nSometimes the user cannot open a series of apps. This is common when apps have been moved or installed to a flash memory card. If the card is removed, malfunctions, or has been wiped, it will cause the user to lose access to that app. Apps can usually be reinstalled from the preferred app store without having to repurchase again.\n\n[file:///fig-488.png]\nMissing apps on an Android phone.\n\nOther issues could be some sort of file corruption. Try uninstalling and reinstalling the app; if the problems persist, consider a factory reset.\n\nNote: Also consider that Mobile Device Management (MDM) software might prevent an app or function from running in a certain context. Security policies might prevent use of the camera within the corporate office, for instance, and any app that requires the camera might then fail to start.\n\nAPP LOG ERRORS\nAs consumer-level devices, iOS and Android do not support simple log viewing tools. An app could choose to display its own logs to the user if required, but an app requires root-level permissions to view system logs or the logs of other apps.\n\nAndroid supports a developer mode, enabled via Settings (access System—-About phone and tap Build number seven times), which can show additional diagnostic information when using apps or making network connections. You can also output debugging information over USB. You can use this in conjunction with the SDK to retrieve system logs. Also, on most Android handsets, you can dial *#*#4636#*#* to open the status page.\n\nYou can view an iOS device's logs from a macOS computer with the Xcode developer tools installed.\n\nSLOW PERFORMANCE\nAs phones get older, their performance naturally degrades as apps are updated to provide more functionality and features. In order to enable these extra features, they require more memory, space, and CPU power. This results in greater battery utilization and a decrease in performance. As space is reduced and the phone is used more intensively, this can lead to an increase in the amount of errors and corruptions.\n\n[file:///fig-489.png]\nRegular clean with CCleaner.\n\nIf soft resets are not working, consider performing a factory reset. When restoring apps and data from backup, try to be selective in choosing what is restored. There are also various apps dedicated to performance optimization and maintenance.  You should also consider any recently installed apps. Having many apps that run some sort of monitoring or connectivity check in the background or apps that display real- time content in a home screen widget will impact performance. You should also check that there is sufficient space left on the flash memory storage.\n\nNote: Vendors try to support device models for as long as possible, but its frequently the case that major (or sometimes minor) version updates can quite severely impact performance if applied to older devices. Unfortunately, vendors tend not to provide a rollback option for version updates. You can only report the issue and hope the vendor supplies a fix.\n\nBATTERY LIFE\nSmartphone batteries degrade over time with each charge and recharge cycle so some decrease in performance is to be expected. Some mobile devices have replaceable batteries but for most models this will be a warranty service operation.\n\nCPU and GPU intensive apps such as games and video playback will drain the battery quickly. A battery charge might be degraded by a faulty or malicious app utilizing high powered peripherals such as GPS, network connections, or even the microphone and camera. You can get information about battery usage via Settings→More→Battery in Android or Settings→Battery in iOS.\n\n[file:///fig-490.png]\nBattery Analyzers for iOS and Android with option to conserve battery.\n\nIt might be appropriate to uninstall the app. Alternatively you might be able to restrict the app from running in the background. In iOS, configure this via\nSettings→General→Background App Refresh. In Android, a battery saver mode can be applied automatically when the charge level drops to a certain percentage or you can apply it manually. To configure it, select Settings→Battery. Tap the top-right ellipse button for the settings menu and select Battery saver.\n\nKeeping your device up-to-date with the latest patches and OS version also ensures optimum operation and battery life conservation.\ntag: C2 L9 TB

GUIDELINES FOR TROUBLESHOOTING MOBILE APP ISSUES\n\nHere are some guidelines to help you troubleshoot mobile app issues.\n\nTROUBLESHOOT MOBILE APP ISSUES\nConsider these guidelines as you troubleshoot the following mobile app issues:\n\n• If an app is not loading, verify that it wasn't installed on a memory card that is not in the mobile device. Verify that the app is not corrupted; uninstall and reinstall the app.\n\n• Examine app log files to determine if the issue can be tracked down in the log file.\n\n• Put the device in developer mode to access log files:\no Android devices: System-+ About phone and tap Build number seven times or dial *#*#46368#*#*.\no iOS devices: Connect the device to a macOS computer with the Xcode developer tools installed.\n\n• Slow performance can be caused by newer apps requiring more resources than are available, reduced battery life, and lack of free storage space. Check that recently installed apps are functioning correctly and are not running in the background.\n\n• Battery life degrades over time. Keep the OS up-to-date to ensure optimum operations and battery life conservation.\ntag: C2 L9 TB

MOBILE WIRELESS ISSUE TROUBLESHOOTING\n\nNetworking is another area where problems occur frequently. On a mobile device, that means troubleshooting wireless connections of different types (Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, or cellular radio). To approach these problems, try to establish whether there is a configuration error or some sort of hardware/interference problem.\n\nTROUBLESHOOTING INTERFERENCE ISSUES\nRadio signals can be affected by the distance between the broadcast and reception antennas and by interference from other devices or by barriers such as thick walls or metal. On a mobile, you should also consider that a low battery charge will weaken the signal strength.\n\nYou can troubleshoot issues with Wi-Fi signal strength using a Wi-Fi Analyzer app installed on the device. Most apps can record the settings in a particular location so that you have a baseline reading to compare to. If the signal varies from the baseline, check what interference sources might have been introduced.\n\n[file:///fig-491.png]\nCell Tower Analyzer (lef) and Wi-Fi Analyzer (right).\n\nA similar utility (Cell Tower Analyzer or GSM Signal Monitor) can be used to analyze cellular radio signals, which use different frequencies to Wi-Fi. An app might combine both functions.\n\nTROUBLESHOOTING WIRELESS CONFIGURATION ISSUES\nIf there is no Wi-Fi, cellular, or Bluetooth connectivity, first check that the device is not in airplane mode or that the particular radio has not been disabled. Next use Settings to verify that the network parameters or Bluetooth pairing information is correct. Try removing the network or Bluetooth pair and reconnecting.\n\nWith Wi-Fi, verify that the access point supports the same 802.11 standard as the device. For example, an access point configured to use 802.11ac only will not be accessible to a smartphone with an 802.11 adapter. The access point must be put into compatibility mode.\n\nIf you can rule out any other configuration errors, consider obtaining an OS or firmware update for the device or for the access point. Research any known issues between the access point and the model of device.\ntag: C2 L9 TB

MOBILE DEVICE SECURITY TROUBLESHOOTING\n\nAs mentioned previously, antivirus software for mobile OS is available but not always that reliable, as new threats and exploits are emerging all the time. You should be alert to general symptoms of malware.\n\nUTILIZATION SYMPTOMS\nMalware or rogue apps are likely to try to collect data in the background. They can become unresponsive and might not shut down when closed. Such apps might cause excessive power drain and high resource utilization. Another telltale sign of a hacked device is reaching the data transmission overlimit unexpectedly. Most devices have an option to monitor data usage and have limit triggers to notify the user if the limit has been reached. This protects from large data bills but should also prompt: the user to check the amount of data used by each application in order to monitor their legitimacy.\n\nUnauthorized location tracking can give away too much sensitive information to third parties. Many apps collect location data; not many explain clearly what they do with it. Most app developers will just want information they can use for targeted advertising, but a rogue app could use location data to facilitate other crimes, such as domestic burglary.\n\n[file:///fig-493.png]\nLocation services in i0S (let) and Android. Note the option to configure location mode/accuracy. \n\nNote: Criminals don't necessarily need to hack a device to get location information. If someone posts pictures online, most will be tagged with location information. A criminal can quite easily get information about where someone lives and then identify when they are on vacation from social media. Users should be trained to strip geotagging information (or all metadata) from images before posting them online.\n\nLocation Services can be turned off completely but this will stop many apps from working. You can disable location services on an app-by-app basis, too.\n\nMobile OSes, like other operating systems, potentially have vulnerabilities that can be exploited to allow an attacker unauthorized root access. Root is an account with system-level access to every process running in the OS. If an attacker has this type of access, they can even remotely activate the camera and microphone. With corporate and government installations, this could cause a security breach of sensitive data. The recommendation is to disable and cover cameras and microphones when in sensitive areas. Some companies and government buildings prevent usage of mobile devices in such areas to avoid unauthorized camera and microphone usage.\n\nGood patch and upgrade management is required to keep the OS current and up to date.\n\nUSER BEHAVIOR ISSUES\nsystem security is not just compromised by malware and hackers. Careless use and failure to follow security best practices cause users to put themselves and the data stored on their devices at risk.\n\nWhen a user needs to connect to the Internet, it can be tempting to use any available open hotspot, especially if the hotspot has the name of a major brand. An open hotspot set up with malicious intent can harvest a huge amount of information. Any data passing over the access point can be intercepted, unless it is protected by encryption (an HTTPS website, an SSL-enabled mail server, or a Virtual Private Network, for instance). There have also been instances where attackers have been able to exploit faults in the certificate-handling processes of the OS and gained the ability to intercept encrypted traffic too.\n\nThere are apps and OS settings that autoconnect to service providers’ hotspots. These should be secure, if you trust the service provider to operate a secure network. If the user notices unintentional behavior, however, such as connecting to a Wi-Fi network without prompting or the Wi-Fi radio turning itself on, suspect a rogue app.\n\nNote: in the context of troubleshooting security issues, ifthe signal from wireless equipment drops unexpectedly or users experience slow data speeds, you might also suspect some sort of jamming or Denial of Service (DoS) attack. An attacker might try to block the signal from a legitimate access point to try to trick users into connecting to a Fogue access point or evil twin.\n\nUnintended Bluetooth pairing is when anonymous devices are allowed to pair with Bluetooth-enabled devices. Once paired, a rogue device could access most of the data and functions on the target device. Bluebugging, for instance, exploited a firmware flaw to allow an attacker to monitor and place telephone calls. Most devices only turn Bluetooth discoverable mode on for a limited amount of time to minimize the risk of rogue pairing events. Bluetooth should be disabled completely when not in use. Also consider the possibility that a rogue app could be changing Bluetooth settings.\n\nSYSTEM LOCKOUT AND UNAUTHORIZED ACCOUNT ACCESS\nA user can be locked out if the device has been disabled either by means of the user forgetting the passcode or remotely by Find My Phone type software if the device is reported stolen. There are a number of ways to re-enable the device. Usually the user has to wait a certain amount of time to try again or use the recovery tool in iTunes (iOS devices) to restore the device.\n\nNote: Lost and stolen devices can expose sensitive corporate data. Data containers mitigate this issue by isolating business data from personal data. A data container creates a virtual environment when the app is Jaunched. Using this virtual environment, the user accesses corporate emails and other corporate data. The app creates an encrypted data store, and the user is not permitted to copy data from outside the container or to move data from within the container. This keeps the business data isolated and secure.\n\nIf an online account becomes locked and the user has not been making the logon. attempts, suspect attempted unauthorized account access. Various data breaches have provided hackers with mountains of authentication credentials and personal information to use to try to access email accounts. Once an email account is compromised, the hacker can typically access any other online account that is not protected by secondary authentication, such as 2-step verification.\n\nWhenever a website or service suffers a data breach and leaks personal files/data, it should notify users immediately. Users need to be alert to the possibility of the theft of their personal information and deploy good security practices, such as not using the same password for two different websites and changing passwords regularly.\n\nTROUBLESHOOTING EMAIL PROBLEMS\nWhen you are troubleshooting an email problem, verify that the user’s credentials and the email server parameters are set correctly (server type, location (IP or URL), port number, and SSL enable/disable). One typical problem with corporate email is where a password change is enforced on the enterprise network but the mobile device has not been updated with the new password.\n\nUsers often want to send confidential email with the assurance that only the recipient can read it. To do this, the recipient sends the sender a digital certificate and the sender uses the public key in that certificate to encrypt the message. The recipient then uses another part of the certificate (the private key) to decrypt the message.\n\nIf the certificate is missing or not recognized, the device will be unable to decrypt the email. Use the email client or encryption program's support documentation to find out how to install or locate the appropriate certificate.\ntag: C2 L9 TB
