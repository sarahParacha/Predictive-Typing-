Lesson 2\nInstalling, Configuring, and Maintaining Operating Systems\n\nLESSON INTRODUCTION\nSo far in this course, you worked with the Microsoft® Windows® operating system. As you know, a CompTIA® A+® technician will probably also be responsible for setting up, maintaining, and troubleshooting computers and devices that have other operating systems installed. Familiarity with other desktop operating systems, such as Linux® and macOS®, will enable you to support more of your user base.\n\nSince so many computers today come with operating system software installed by the vendor, an ordinary user might never need to install an operating system. As an IT professional, however, you might be called upon to install operating systems for a variety of reasons: if the original installation does not meet a user's needs; if the system needs to be upgraded; if you are redeploying a system from one user to another; or even if you need to complete a brand new build and construct a computer entirely from scratch. In all of these cases, you will need to be able to install, configure, and maintain the computer's operating system.\n\nLESSON OBJECTIVES\nIn this lesson, you will:\n• Configure and use Linux.\n• Configure and use macOS.\n• Install and upgrade operating systems.\n• Perform OS maintenance tasks.\ntag:C2 L2

Topic A\nConfigure and Use Linux\n\nEXAM OBJECTIVES COVERED\n1002-1.3 Summarize general OS installation considerations and upgrade methods.\n1002-1.9 Given a scenario, use features and tools of the Mac OS and Linux client/desktop operating systems.\n\nThe various operating systems you might encounter use different tools, but the functionality of those tools is common across all types of systems. You will need to configure disks and file systems, user accounts, and software applications. \n\nMany individuals and organizations have adopted Linux as a desktop and server OS. because of its high security, low cost, and ease of licensing. In this topic, you will examine the basics of Linux so that you can begin to understand and appreciate its benefits.\ntag:C2 L2 TA

THE LINUX OPERATING SYSTEM\n\nLike all operating systems, Linux enables the most basic common system operations, such as file management, user account management, and so forth. It provides a means for users to interact with their computer's hardware and software.\ntag:C2 L2 TA

DISTRIBUTIONS\n\nThe core of Linux is called the kernel and this is the same on all versions or distributions (distros). The kernel is the software component that provides the core set of operating system functions. These include features for managing system hardware and for communicating between software and hardware. A Linux distribution is a complete Linux implementation, including kernel, shell, applications, utilities, and installation media, that is packaged, distributed, and supported by a software vendor. Common distributions include:\n\n• Red Hat/Centos—the most commercially successful distribution. Also, the CentOS distribution is a stable, predictable, manageable, and reproducible platform derived from the sources of Red Hat® Enterprise Linux® (RHEL). CentOS is maintained by The CentOS Project, a community-driven free software effort that is modeled on the structure of the Apache® Foundation and has its own governing board. CentOS benefits from Red Hat's ongoing contributions and investment.\n\n• SUSE®—originally developed in Germany, the company was bought out by US networking company Novell.\n\n• Debian/Ubuntu®—one of the many volunteer-driven distributions. Ubuntu is one of most widely used versions of Debian.\n\n• Knoppix—another popular Debian derivative.\n\nThese are some of the more popular distributions for PCs. There are a huge number of flavors, many of which have been developed for specialist applications such as running routers, set-top boxes, smart TVs, Internet of Things (IoT) devices, and so on. The smartphone OS, Android™, is based on Linux.\n\nLINUX DESKTOP OPTIONS\nLinux was originally developed with a Command-Line Interface (CLI) or shell very much like UNIX.\n\nToday many users of Linux still use the bash shell and server-based editions will often only have the command-line environment installed. For this reason, itis important that support technicians are comfortable with using Linux shell commands. Many system tasks still require the use of the command even if a GUI environment is running. Within a GUI, you can open a terminal window to run shell commands.\n\nNote: There are other CLI shells, include Bourne (sh), C Shell (csh), and Korn (ksh).\n\nFor ease of use, many distributions aimed at end user PCs have a graphical shell loaded. Some popular GUI shells include:\n\n• Gnome (GNU Object Model Environment}—the oldest and most widely deployed GUI. Used by default on Fedora® and Debian.\n\nNote: GNU is a recursive acronym standing for “GNU is Not UNIX." Many of the non-kernel bits of software developed under the open source GNU license to replace their proprietary UNIX equivalents can be used with Linux.\n\n• KDE® (K Desktop Environment)—a very popular GUI often used by SUSE.\n\n• Cinnamon—based on the MINT GUI.\n\n• Xfce—one of the many lightweight GUIs, designed for systems with less RAM and CPU power.\n\nA typical Linux GUI desktop looks like the image in the following figure.\n\n(https://4sorcero.s3.amazonaws.com/byteback/core_2/fig_core_2_95.png)\nLinux GUI desktop\n\nIt is worth noting that although the desktop can vary from distro to distro, most will have a common theme, with a start menu, taskbar, system tray, and so on, in a similar fashion to Windows and macOS. It should also be noted that unlike Windows and Mac, the default GUI shell can be swapped for a different one. Many GUls, including Gnome, will support features like virtual desktop (Mission Control on macOS).\n\nMany distros will come with a range of open source applications pre-installed such as Firefox® Browser and office applications such as Libre.\n\nOne thing that does vary from one distro to another is system tools. SUSE, for example, comes with a tool called YaST which provides a Control Panel style utility for Linux. Other similar tools are webmin and Yumix. However, it should be noted that all these tools simply update the standard Linux configuration files stored in the /etc folder.\n\n(https://4sorcero.s3.amazonaws.com/byteback/core_2/fig_core_2_95.png)\nYaST Control Center.\ntag:C2 L2 TA

LINUX COMMANDS\n\nLinux commands are entered in a standard format, featuring the command followed bya space then a number of options (or switches) and/or arguments, depending on the function of the command, Wildcards (* and ?) can be used in the same way as at the Windows command line.\n\n• The first "word" input is interpreted as the command. This could be a full or relative path to the executable or just the name of an executable stored in a directory identified by a PATH environment variable. The command “word" is completed by the first space character.\n\n• Options (or switches) are used to change the operation of a command. They can. be single letters (preceded by a single hyphen) or words (preceded by a double hyphen). The order the options are placed on the command is not important.\n\n• Arguments are values supplied to the command for it to operate on, such as file names. Arguments should be supplied in the correct order for the command's syntax.\n\nYou can send or redirect the results of one command to another command. Pipes are used to combine Linux tools on a single command line, enabling you to use the output of one command as the input to another. The pipe symbol is a vertical bar ( | ), which you type between two commands.\n\nYou can issue more than one command before pressing Enter. Place a semicolon (;) between the commands and they will be issued one after the other.\n\nCASE SENSITIVITY\nCommands, parameters, and file and directory names are all case sensitive in Linux. For example, 1s -1 file.dataand1s -L File.data would produce completely different results. Using capitals in the command name would generate an error message,\n\nGETTING HELP\nAny Linux command will generally give a reasonably detailed explanation of its function and syntax when the --help parameter is used. The help is often several pages long so use of the | more (pipe) at the end of the command is recommended on any command that generates large amounts of output. It shows the results a page at a time. For example: ls --help | more\n\nAlternatively, you can use man to view the help pages for a particular command. For example, use man man to view the help pages for the man command.\n\nNote: Also note that Linux terminals support Tab completion to help in entering commands. You can use Shift+Page Up or Shift+Page Down and Ctrl+Shift+Up Arrow or Ctrl+Shift+Down Arrow to scroll. Use the Up and Down arrow keys to scroll through previously used commands. Use q to quit a command.\ntag:C2 L2 TA

LINUX DISK AND FILE MANAGEMENT\n\nIn Linux, the directory structure is defined as a File System Hierarchy. Unlike Windows, drive letters like C: or D: are not used. The file system starts at the root, represented by /. Directories and subdirectories can be created from the root to store files.\n\nIt is important to realize that everything available to the Linux OS is represented as a file in the file system, including devices. This is referred to as the unified file system. For example, a single hard drive attached to a SATA port would normally be represented in the file system by /dev/sda. A second storage device—perhaps one attached to a USB port—would be represented as /dev/sdb.\n\nWhen Linux boots, a system kernel and virtual file system are loaded to a RAM drive. The virtual file system identifies the location of the persistent root partition from the appropriate storage device and loads the file system stored on the disk.\n\nMOUNTING PARTITIONS\nA file system configured on a partition on a particular storage device is attached to a particular directory (mount point) within the unified file system using the mount command. For example, the following command mounts partition 1 on the mass storage device sda to the directory /mnt/diskC.\n\nmount /dev/sdal /mnt/diskC\n\nMountable file systems are listed in the /etc/fstab file.\n\nNote: Think of the root filesystem representing everything on the computer as "THE" file system and a filesystem for a particular partition as just "A" filesystem.\n\nLINUX FILE SYSTEMS\nMost Linux distributions use some version of the ext file system to format partitions on mass storage devices. ext3 is a 64-bit file system with support for journaling, which means that the file system tracks changes, giving better reliability and less chance of file corruption in the event of crashes or power outages. Support for journaling is the main difference between ext3 and its predecessor (ext2). ext4 delivers significantly better performance than ext3 and would usually represent the best choice for new systems.\n\nLinux can also support FAT/FAT32, though it is designated as VFAT. Additional protocols, such as the Network File System (NFS), can be used to mount remote storage devices into the local file system.\n\n(https://4sorcero.s3.amazonaws.com/byteback/core_2/fig_core_2_98.png)\nUsing Yast format partition\n\nSWAP PARTITION\nVirtual memory allows a computer to use disk space to supplement the amount of system RAM installed. If applications or data files use up the available physical memory, "pages" of data from RAM can be written to swap space on a disk to free up some space. If the paged data is required again, itis transferred from the swap space back to RAM.\n\nMost default installations of Linux create a swap partition to use as swap space. The swap partition is formatted with a minimal kind of file system. It can only be used by the memory manager and not for storage of ordinary data files.\n\nDISK MANAGEMENT COMMANDS\nThe file system choice can be made when the disk has been partitioned. Most Linux distros provide GUI tools for managing disks and file systems, but the following represent the main command-line options:\n• fdisk—used to create and manage partitions on a hard disk.\n• mkfs—used to format a partition.\n• mkswap—used to format a swap partition. The swapon command is used to activate the partition as swap space.\n• dd—make a copy of an input file (if=) to an output file (of=) and apply optional conversions to the file data. One notable use of di is to clone a disk (in the following, sda might be the fixed drive and sdb a removable drive): dd if=/dev/sda of=/dev/sdb\no You would need to boot from a live CD so that the file system was not mounted\nat the time of cloning. You can also clone a disk to a disk image (.img) file: dd if=/dev/sda of=/mnt/usbstick/backup.img\no To restore, you could simply reverse the input and output files: dd if=/mnt/usbstick/backup.img of=/dev/sda\ntag:C2 L2 TA

NAVIGATION IN THE LINUX DIRECTORY STRUCTURE\n\nThe core commands that a technician should know to navigate the Linux file structure include 1s, cp, mv, rm, and cd, along with many more. This table describes these commands and how to use them.\n\n(https://4sorcero.s3.amazonaws.com/byteback/core_2/table_core_2_99.png)\n(https://4sorcero.s3.amazonaws.com/byteback/core_2/table_core_2_100.png)\n(https://4sorcero.s3.amazonaws.com/byteback/core_2/table_core_2_101.png)\n\n1s is used to list files: The 1s command is used to display a folder in the same way as dir at the Windows command prompt. Popular parameters include -l to display a detailed (long) list and -a to display all files including hidden or system files. The following example shows the entire contents of the /etc directory in a detailed format: 1s -l -a /etc\n\npwd is used to print working directory: The pwd command simply displays the current directory you are working in. Any commands you use which don't specify a directory will assume your current one. The prompt on some distros will show your current working directory or a ~ symbol, which indicates you are in your home directory.\n\ncd is used to change directory: The cd command is used to change your working directory. Typical syntax would be:\n• cd /etc —change directory to /etc. This is an absolute path (begins with /) so will work regardless of your current directory.\n• cd documents —change your directory to a subdirectory called documents. This is a relative path. The documents directory must exist below the current directory.\n• cd .. —change your directory to the parent directory of the one you are currently working in.\n\ncp is used to copy files: The cp command is used to create a copy of files either in the same or different folder with the same or different name.\nFor example:\n• cp file1.txt file1.old —copy file1.txt in the current working directory to a new file called file1.old in the same directory.\n• cp /etc/hosts /tmp —copy the file hosts from the directory /etc into the directory /tmp, keeping the file name the same.\n• cp -v /var/log/message* /home/usera —copy all files beginning with the name message from the /var/log directory into /home/usera. The -v option displays the files copied.\n\nmy is used to move files: The mv command is used to either move files from one\ndirectory to another or rename a file. For example:\n• mv /home/usera/data.txt /tmp —move the file data.txt from the /home/usera directory to the /tmp directory, keeping the file name the same.\n• mv alarm.dat /tmp/alarm.bak —move and rename the file alarm.dat in the current directory to alarm.bak in /tmp.\n• mv /var/log/app1.log /var/log/ app1.old —rename the file app1.dat in the /var/log folder to app1.old.\n\nrm is used to remove files: The rm command is potentially very dangerous if used incorrectly. Although its main role is to delete files, with an additional parameter (-r) it can also be used to delete directories. For example:\n• rm data.old —remove the single file data.old from the current working directory.\n• rm /var/log/*.bak —removeall files ending in .bak from the /var/log directory.\n• rm -r /home/usera/data—remove the contents of the entire directory tree underneath the folder /home/usera/data.\n\nCaution: Use the ~ x switch with caution!\n\nNote: Remember that Linux commands operate without prompts, allowing you to cancel.\n\ngrep is used to filter files: The grep (Globally search a Regular Expression and Print) command is used to search and filter the contents of files, displaying the lines that match the search string. The search string can be a simple text value to match (a literal) or can Use a sophisticated pattern-matching system called regular expressions (regex). grep is especially useful for searching long files such as system logs. For example, the following command displays only the lines in the Linux system log file for messages that contain the text uid=1003, ignoring the case of the text:\n• grep -I "uid=1003" /var/log/messages\n\nThe grep command can also be used to search a directory for a certain file. The ls -l | grep audit command returns a long listing of any files in the current directory whose name contains audit.\ntag:C2 L2 TA

LINUX FILE EDITORS\n\nvi or vim is a text file editor derived from a UNIX original. Although this tool is very powerful, it is based on letter- and number-based commands to modify the text. For example, dd when pressed will delete the whole line the cursor is on; 5dd would delete 5 whole lines. When vi is in command mode, input such as this is interpreted as a command.\n\nTo enter text, you need to switch to insert mode by pressing an appropriate command key. For example, i switches to insert mode at the current cursor position, a appends text at the end of the current line, and 0 inserts text on a new line below the current line. The Esc key switches from insert mode back to command mode.\n\nTo save a file, use :w from command mode. To save and quit, use :wq. :q! quits without saving.\n\nThere are other command-line editors, such as mcedit, nano, pico, or joe, that are easier to learn to use.\ntag:C2 L2 TA

LINUX USER ACCOUNTS\n\nLinux, like most operating systems, supports multiple users. The root user, also known as the superuser, is the default administrative account on a Linux system. This account can do anything on the system. You should only use this account when absolutely necessary. For most Linux distributions, you create a regular user when you are installing Linux. This is the user you should log on as for day-to-day tasks. Even many administrative tasks can be performed more safely under the regular user account.\n\nUser accounts are linked to a primary group, which determines many aspects of security in Linux. User settings are stored in the /etc/passwd file and group settings are stored in the /etc/group file. The user password is typically stored as an encrypted hash in the /etc/shadow file, along with other password settings, such as age and expiration date. The command-line utilities useradd, usermod, and userdel can be used to add, modify, and delete user information. The groupadd, groupmod, and groupde1 commands can be used to manage groups.\n\nA user can belong to many groups but can only have one effective group ID at any one time, The effective group ID is listed for the user account in etc/passwd and can be changed using the newgrp command.\n\nMany distros have GUL-based utilities that allow user and group management. YaST is an example of one of these.\n\n(https://4sorcero.s3.amazonaws.com/byteback/core_2/fig_core_2_102.png)\nUser and group Administration tool in YasT.\n\nsu (Superuser)\nThe su command allows a normal Linux user to become superuser (or root). The command will prompt the user for the root user's password. Additionally, it is possible to put a different user name after the su command and become that user, assuming the password is known.\n\nUsing su without an option retains the original user's profile and variables. The switched user also remains in the home directory of the original user. Using su - changes users and launches a new shell under the context of that new user. This is a much better practice.\n\nsudo (Superuser Do)\nThe sudo command allows a normal user to run specified commands with superuser privilege level. The superuser first has to edit the /etc/sudoers file listing the commands and users that are allowed to run them. The user enters the sudo command followed by the path of the command they wish to run. The user might be asked to confirm his or her password, if it has not been cached recently.\n\npasswd (Password Utility)\nThe passwd command allows a user to change their own password or superuser (root) to change or reset someone else's. When a user runs the command, Linux will prompt first for the existing password then the new one, twice. The superuser can reset another user's password by typing the user name after the command. The existing password is not required in this case, To reset the password for the user fredb, the superuser would enter the command passwd fredb\n\nNote: Don't confuse passwd with pwd (Print Working Directory).\ntag:C2 L2 TA

LINUX FILE SYSTEM PERMISSIONS,\n\nThe Linux file system has a relatively simple security system compared to Windows NTFS. There are just three different rights, as shown in the following table.\n\n(https://4sorcero.s3.amazonaws.com/byteback/core_2/table_core_2_103a.png)\n\nRead (r): View the contents of a file or directory.\nWrite (w): Modify or delete the object (in the case of directories, allows adding, deleting, or renaming files within the directory).\nExecute (x): Run an executable file or script. For directories, execute allows the user to do things like change the focus to the directory and access or search items within it.\n\nFor each object, these permissions are set for the owner, for the group the owner belongs to or that the object has been assigned to, and for other users ("the world"). Using symbolic notation, each permission is allowed (r or w or x) or denied (-). If you. run 1s -l to obtain a directory listing, directory or file object permissions will be shown as follows:\n\n• drwxr-xr-x 2 administrator administrator Desktop\n• -rw-rw-r- 1 administrator administrator MEMO.txt\n\nThe leading character designates the file type. For example, - represents a regular file and d indicates a directory. The permissions for the Desktop directory show that the owner (administrator) has full (rwx) permissions, whereas the group (also administrator) and others have read and execute (r-x). For the MEMO.txt file, the user and group have read/write (rw-) permissions, whereas others has read permissions only (r--),\n\nPermissions can also be expressed numerically, using the octal value format shown in the following table. An octal value can represent up to eight digits (0-7):\n\n(https://4sorcero.s3.amazonaws.com/byteback/core_2/table_core_2_103b.png)\n\n0 --- 0000 Deny all\n1 --x 0001 Execute\n2 -w- 0010 Write\n3 -wx 0011 Write and execute\n4 r-- 0100 Read-only\n5 r-x 0101 Read and execute\n6 rw- 0110 Read and write\n7 rwx 0111 Allow all\n\nSo, for example, a file with numeric permission 0775 (the leading zero identifies the value as an octal, but can often be omitted) grants all rights to the owner and the owner's group and Read/Execute rights to everyone else.\n\nNote: Remember that Execute=1, Write=2, and Read=4—add those values together to get a particular combination of permissions\n\nFrom the shell, the chmod command can be used to secure files and directories, using either symbolic or octal notation. Only the owner can change permissions. The command chown allows the superuser to change the owner of a file or directory, Whereas chg rp can be used to change the group.\n\n(https://4sorcero.s3.amazonaws.com/byteback/core_2/fig_core_2_104.png)\nModifying permissions using the chmod command.\ntag:C2 L2 TA

LINUX SOFTWARE MANAGEMENT\n\nA distribution contains any software packages the distribution vendor or sponsor considers appropriate. Copies of these packages (including any updates) will be posted to a software repository. Often the vendor will maintain different repositories. For example, there may be one for officially supported package versions, one for beta/ untested versions, and one for "at own risk" unsupported packages.\n\nThe integrity of a package is usually tested by making a cryptographic hash of the compiled package, using a function such as MDS or SHA-256. The hash value and function is published on the package vendor's site. When you download a package, you can run the same function on the package file (using a command such as mdSsum or sha256sum) and compare the output with the published value. If they do not match, you should not proceed with the installation.\n\nPACKAGE MANAGERS (APT-GET)\nLinux software is made available both as source code and as pre-compiled applications. A source code package needs to be run through the appropriate compiler with the preferred options. Pre-compiled packages can be installed using various tools, such as rpm (Red Hat Package Manager), apt (Debian), or yum (Fedora), Many distributions also provide GUI package manager front-ends to these command-line tools.\n\n(https://4sorcero.s3.amazonaws.com/byteback/core_2/fig_core_2_105.png)\nYaST package manager in SUSE.\n\nThe following uses of apt - get. provide some examples of how packages are managed at the command line:\n\n• apt-get update —refresh the local database with information about the packages available from the repository.\n\n• apt-get upgrade —update all packages with the latest versions.\n\n• apt-get install PackageName —install a new application.\ntag:C2 L2 TA

LINUX SYSTEM COMMANDS\n\nThere are many tools and techniques available to troubleshoot issues with applications or update the network configuration. You should also know how to shut down or reboot a Linux PC.\n\n(https://4sorcero.s3.amazonaws.com/byteback/core_2/table_core_2_105.png)\n(https://4sorcero.s3.amazonaws.com/byteback/core_2/table_core_2_106.png)\n\nps and kill The ps command displays the Linux processes (programs) that are currently running. Each process has a system generated process ID which can be used with the ki11 command to end the process. The parameter -ef displays processes being run by all users along with a more detailed display.\n\nifconfig and iwconfig The ifconfig and iwconfig tools display the current state of the network interfaces within Linux. ifconfig is the original tool designed for cabled Ethernet interfaces, whereas iwconfig displays information about the wireless adapters configured within the system.\n\nshutdown Linux is designed to be a very stable operating system and the server versions often run non-stop for months or even years at a time. However, the desktop versions are likely to be powered on and off much more often. The shut down command has two main parameters: ~h to halt or -r to reboot the system followed by when the event should take place. Examples of this could be now, +10 (+10 meaning ten minutes from now), or 17:30 (to specify an exact time).\ntag:C2 L2 TA

Activity 2-2\nConfiguring and Using Linux\n\nBEFORE YOU BEGIN\nComplete this activity by using Hyper-V Manager and the LX1 (Cent OS Linux) VM.\nRemember that all commands and input in Linux are case-sensitive.\nWhenever you are prompted for a password, use Pa$$w0rd.\n\nSCENARIO\nIn this activity, you will investigate some of the features of the Linux GNOME desktop environment, plus some command-line tools.\n\n1. Use Hyper-V Manager to start the LX1 VM and sign on using the account centos and password Pa$sword. Identify the main elements of the desktop environment.\n\na) In Hyper-V Manager, right-click LX1 and select Start. Double-click the VM to open the connection window.\n\nb) When the VM has booted, select the centos account icon.\n\nc) Type Password and then press Enter to sign on.\n\nNote: The first time users log in, they are prompted to configure localization settings. If a Welcome screen is displayed, accept the defaults or other settings as your instructor suggests.\n\nd) View the desktop.\n\n(https://4sorcero.s3.amazonaws.com/byteback/core_2/fig_core_2_109.png)\n\ne) Note the following features of the desktop.\n• The Applications menu contains shortcuts to software, while Places contains shortcuts to file system locations.\n• The right-hand icon on the menu bar accesses settings, plus options for signing out or shutting down the PC.\n• The bottom taskbar shows open windows. You can switch between workspaces (multiple desktops) using the 1/4 icon at the bottom right.\n\nf) Select the power icon and then select the Settings icon. Browse some of the\noptions, such as Network. The Settings page contains configuration options similar to Windows Control Panel.\n\ng) Close the Settings window.\n\n2. Use the file browser to identify some of the principal directories in the Linux file system.\n\na) Double-click the Home icon on the desktop. This starts in the current user's home directory.\n\n(https://4sorcero.s3.amazonaws.com/byteback/core_2/fig_core_2_110.png)\n\nb) Select Other Locations and then Computer to view the File System Hierarchy (FSH).\n\n(https://4sorcero.s3.amazonaws.com/byteback/core_2/fig_core_2_111.png)\n\nNote some of the key root directories.\n• /boot —boot loader files.\n• /etc —computer-level configuration files.\n• /var —variable files, such as logs, print spoolers, and cache.\n• /usr —shareable and read-only data and binaries.\n• /bin and /sbin —core and system binary files (applications).\n• /mnt —location for temporary file systems.\n• /dev —files representing devices.\n\nd) You can see the top-level home directory here. if you open this you will see the directory for the centos user.\n\n3. Linux is predominantly configured via commands operating on text-based configuration files.\n\na) Right-click the desktop and select Open Terminal.\n\nb) In the terminal window, type ls -l and press Enter.\n\nThis displays a detailed list of files in the current folder (with permissions, modified date, and so on).\n\nc) Type cd desktop and press Enter. Why does this return an error message?\nThe directory is Desktop, not desktop. Remember that the Linux file system is case-sensitive.\n\nd) Use the correct command to change to the Desktop directory then use Is to return a file list. Is the directory empty?\n\ne) In the terminal window, type vi and press Enter.\nThis text editor opens in command mode.\n\nNote: For users familiar with Microsoft Windows editors such as Notepad, vi can seem challenging at first. With a little practice and memorizing some of the important modes and commands, it becomes easier to use.\n\nf) Type i to switch to insert mode at the current cursor position. Notice that the bottom of the window now shows ~ INSERT ~ to indicate that you are in insert mode. Type the following lines:\n\nI'm learning to use vi\nIt's easy when you know how\n\ng) Press Esc to exit insert mode and return to command mode, and then type dd\nWhenever you are about to issue a command, always use Esc first.\n\nh) Press Esc, and then type :w he1lo-vi. txt and press Enter to save the file as hello-vi.txt in the current directory.\nThe :w is the command to write the file to the current directory. Linux doesn't require or use filename extensions, but adding a file extension helps users to identity the file type and makes it easier to share files with Windows users.\n\ni) Press Ese, and then type G followed by 0.\n\nThe G moves to the last line of the file. The lower case 0 opens a new line after the current line and places you in insert mode. If you typed a capital O, it would open a new line before the current line.\n\nj) Type the following line:\nIt could take a while\n\nk) Press Esc, type :q! and press Enter to quit the editor without saving changes.\nIf you typed :q without the !, you would see an error message that the file was not written since the last change and be prompted to issue the command with the ! to override and close without saving.\n\nl) Type cp hello-vi.txt ../Documents/ and press Enter to copy the file to the Documents directory.\n\nm) Type cd / and press Enter to switch to the root directory.\n\n4. You can use the find and grep tools to search for files and file contents. Try to locate the httpd.conf file within the /etc directory, extract specific messages from the boot log (dmesg), and locate references to the network adapter (eth) in the system log (/var/log/messages).\n\na) At the terminal, run the following command to get help on the find command.\nman find\n\nIf you want to see more of the man page than fits on the screen, press Spacebar to view the next page, or press Enter to display the next line.\n\nb) Press q to quit the help file.\n\nc) Run the following command to locate httpd.conf (the principal configuration file for the Apache web server).\nfind /etc -name ‘httpd.conf'\n\nObserve that a lot of Permission Denied errors are returned. You can prefix the command with sudo so that the search can access those directories. Alternatively, you can filter out the errors by using grep.\n\nfind /etc -name ‘httpd.conf’ 2>&1 | grep -v ‘Permission denied!\n\nNote: If this prints with a break in the command, enter it as a single command (ignoring the line break}.\n\nThe -v switch is a way of specifying NOT the matched string. The parameter 2>&1 ensures that the error output is included in the string piped to grep.\n\nd) Run the command dmesg to show the contents of the boot log. You can see that this is a long list of output so using a search tool will be very helpful.\n\ne) Run the following command to filter for events relating to initializing the disks:\n\ndmesg | grep 'sd\|mount’\n\nWithin the match expression, the pipe character (|) works as a logical OR. It must be escaped using \| however. The effect is to search for the keywords sd OR mount.\n\nf) To search the system log for references to the network adapter, use the following command—confirm with Pa$$w0rd when you are prompted:\n\nsudo grep ‘eth’ /var/log/ messages | less\n\nNote that less is similar to more. It allows you to view the output one page at a time but also to scroll back up through the output.\n\ng) Press Q to quit viewing the output.\n\n5. Next, create a new user account named Sam with the password Pa$$wOrd. Create a group named SharedDisk and add Sam to the group.\n\na) Create the new group first, by running the following command:\n\nsudo groupadd SharedDisk\n\nb) Create the new user account, and add it to the group with the following command:\n\nsudo useradd -G SharedDisk Sam\n\n©) Configure the user password by running the following command:\n\nsudo passwd Sam\n\nWhen prompted, enter and confirm the password as Pa$$w0rd\n\nNote that CentOS correctly advises you that this is a bad password to use. It is especially bad to use it for each user account, including root.\n\nd) To test the account, press Ctrl+Alt+F2 to open a new console, Enter the user name Sam and confirm the password when prompted.\n\ne) Switch back to the centos user console by pressing Ctrl+Alt+F1\n\n6. The LX1 VM has a second virtual disk attached. For the next step, list the disks attached to the system, and then configure and format a file system on the second device.\n\na) In the terminal window, type Sudo fdisk -l and press Enter.\n\n(https://4sorcero.s3.amazonaws.com/byteback/core_2/fig_core_2_113.png)\n\nb) Examine the results. \n\nfdisk shows information about the disk. sda is the disk that CentOS is installed to While sdb is the unformatted disk. On sda, you can see three partitions, for the EFI system, boot files (note that fdisk reports XFS as Microsoft basic ), and an LVM Partition. Logical Volume Manager (LVM) is used to divide this partition into logical block devices, hosting volumes for root and home storage areas plus a swap partition. The advantage of using LVM, rather than basic partitions, is that the volumes can be shrunk or expanded or configured with some sort of RAID protection as required.\n\nc) run sudo parted -l and compare the output to fdisk.\n\nNote that parted correctly reports the file system type as XFS. Most other Linux distributions use ext3 or ext, but XFS is the default in CentOS and RedHat.\n\nd) To use parted to initialize the disk and create a new partition using all the available disk space, run the following commands in sequence (press Enter after each command):\n\nsudo parted /dev/sdb\nprint free\nmklabel gpt\nmkpart primary\n\ne) Respond to the prompts with the following input to choose a file system type and set the start and end of the partition:\n\nfat32\n0%\n100%\n\nf) Run the following commands to check the new partition was created successfully and quit parted:\n\nprint\nquit\n\nNote the warning about updating /etc/fstab. While you have created a partition, you have not yet mounted it to make it available for file storage. /etc/fstab is a file containing a list of file systems to mount at boot time.\n\ng) Run lsblk to view the new disk and partition structure.\n\nh) Run the following command to format the new partition, using FAT32:\n\nsudo mkfs.vfat -n SharedDisk /dev/sdb1\n\n7. Create a directory to host the new partition and then mount it to that directory.\nSee if you can set permissions to restrict use to the SharedDisk group. Use man\nMount to research the command syntax.\n\na) Create a directory for the mount point, and then mount the partition using the following commands (ignore the line break in the mount command):\n\nsudo mkdir /media/disk1\nsudo mount -t vfat /dev/sdb1 /media/disk1 -o rw.umask=0007.gid=SharedDisk.uid=Sam\n\nThe mount options set the disk to read/write mode and configure the default permissions (umask). The mask contains values to subtract from the permissions granted, so this mask means files and folders are created on the partition with 0770\n(rwx for the owner and group but no permissions for world}. If you were to set the mask to 0022, the default permissions would be 0755 (rwx for the owner, rx for the group and world), The gid and uid parameters set the default group and user.\n\nb) Run the following command to view the file systems formatted with XFS or FAT that are currently mounted:\n\nmount | grep 'xfs\| fat’\n\nNote that the partition is only mounted temporarily. To mount at boot, the partition must be added to /etc/fstab. You won't attempt that in this activity\n\nc) Run nano /media/disk1/hello.txt to try to create a text file on the new partition. Add some text then use Ctrl40 plus Enter to try to save the file.\n\nPermission is denied. Only the user account Sam and members of the group SharedDisk have access.\n\nd) Press Ctrl+X to close nano, responding with n to the prompt.\n\ne) Run the following commands to add the centos user account to the SharedDisk group and then to make that group current.\n\nsudo usermod -a -G SharedDisk centos\nnewgrp SharedDisk\n\nf) Run nano /media/disk1/hello.txt to create a text file on the new partition. Add some text then use Ctrl+0 and then press Enter to save the file.\n\nThis should work.\n\ng) Press Ctrl+X to close nano.\n\nh) Press Ctrl+Alt+F2 to switch to the Sam user's console. Run the following command to view the partition and open the file:\n\ncd /media/disk1\nls -l\nnano hello.txt\n\ni) Check that you can modify the file then save and close it.\n\n8. Use the du and df commands to check disk space and usage, and then unmount the SharedDisk partition and run an integrity check using fsck.\n\na) Press Ctrl+Alt+F1 to switch back to the centos user's console.\n\nb) Run the following command to show available space on all file systems except temporary ones:\n\ndf | grep -v ‘tmpfs'\n\nc) Run the following command to check how much space files in your home profile are using:\n\ndu /home/centos\n\nd) Try to unmount the SharedDisk partition by running the following command:\n\nsudo umount /dev/sdb1\n\nNote the error.\n\ne) Switch to Sam's console and change focus to the default directory by running cd without arguments.\n\nf) Switch back to the administrator console and run umount again—it should work this time:\n\nsudo umount /dev/sdb1\n\ng) Use the following command to run an integrity check on the disk:\n\nsudo fsck.vfat /dev/sdb1\n\n9. Finally, use the ps and top utilities to report on process usage.\n\na) Run ps -ef to show extended information (-f) about processes started by all users (-e).\n\nIn the output, you can see the user and Process ID (PID). The C column shows an index of CPU usage. Note also the processes running in tty2 (Sam's console).\n\nb) Run the top command. This is a simple means of showing which processes are most active.\n\nc) Press q to quit.\n\n10. Use the command line to shut down the VM.\n\na) Run the following command to try to shut down the VM\n\nshutdown -h now\n\nb) Scroll up to locate the PID (the number in the second column of the ps-ef output) for Sam (or rerun the ps -ef command) and record the PID for login- Sam. Run the following commands to kill Sams session and shut down:\n\nsudo kill SamPID\nshutdown -h now\n\nNote that you are just using the kill command for this activity. This is not a good way to end a user's session,\n\n11. At the end of each activity, you need to close the VM. You will always discard any changes you made.\n\na) From the connection window, select Action→Revert.\n\nb) If you are prompted to confirm, select the Revert button.\ntag:C2 L2 TA A2-2

Topic B\nConfigure and Use macOS\n\nEXAM OBJECTIVES COVERED\n1002-1.3 Summarize general OS installation considerations and upgrade methods.\n1002-1.9 Given a scenario, use features and tools of the Mac OS and Linux client/desktop operating systems.\n\nMac® computers from Apple® use the macOS® operating system. Mac users tend to be found in art, music, graphic design, and education because macOS includes apps geared to those audiences. In this topic, you will examine some of the important\nfeatures and functions of macOs.\ntag:C2 L2 TB

APPLE MACS AND macOS.\n\nmacOS is the generic name for the operating system that powers Apple Mac computers. It was formerly known as Mac OS (from launch until 2001) and then OS X (from 2001 through to 2016). All macOS versions are based on UNIX technology, and many "under the hood" commands are shared between the two operating systems.\n\nWhereas Microsoft Windows can be installed and used on any PC with Intel architecture, macOS may only be installed on Apple's own hardware. By creating what has become known as a “walled garden" for their computers and software, Apple has been able to impose strict quality controls on the apps and devices that are available for the Mac. This has ensured that, compared to Windows, there are fewer outbreaks of viruses and malware and fewer system stability issues caused by faulty drivers or application/device conflicts.\n\nNote: You might hear the term "Hackintosh," which refers to installing macOS on non-Apple hardware, often as a virtual machine. Apple's license agreement only permits installation on Apple hardware.\n\nNote that macOS and iOS are separate operating systems. There are several visual and operational similarities between macOS and iOS and there are utilities to exchange information between the two, but it is not possible to run programs built for macOS on iOS and vice versa. iOS® is purely an OS for the iPhone® and iPad, whereas macOS is only used for desktop and laptop computers.\n\nOS X AND macOS VERSIONS\nSince its release in 2001, OS X (and now macOS) has undergone regular 10.x updates and revisions to keep pace with updates to Apple Mac hardware. Updates and new versions are distributed free of charge through the App Store. OS X versions were originally named after big cats and then places in California; something that continues, with the latest macOS releases.\n\nUnless the hardware is particularly old and can't be upgraded, most Apple Mac computers will now be running macOS High Sierra (10.13) or macOS Mojave (10.14). OS X 10.7 (Lion) is the earliest release that is still supported by Apple. If your Macintosh computer meets the minimum requirements for OS X installation, the hardware should all be compatible with the latest version of macOS. You can verify that your hardware is supported by examining the technical specifications at support.apple.com/specs.\n\nAPPLE INPUT DEVICES\nYou should be aware of some differences between the input devices used for Macs and those used for PCs.\n\nApple Keyboards and Mice\nAlthough a Windows keyboard can be used on an Apple Mac (and vice versa), there are  a number of differences between the keys:\n\n• Command—the equivalent of Ctrl on a Windows keyboard. For example, command+C will copy to the clipboard as Ctrl+C does on a Windows computer. If you're using a Windows keyboard on a Mac, use the Windows key as the command key.\n\n• Option—equivalent of the Alt key.\n\n• Control—not the equivalent of Ctrl on a Windows keyboard!\n\nApple mice do not feature obvious buttons. Older mice have five sensors that can be set to different actions via System Preferences. The later Magic Mouse models have a touchpad surface with gesture support. The Magic Trackpad has a larger working surface.\n\nNote: You can set up right-click in System Preferences or use Control+click.\n\nAPPLE MAGIC TRACKPAD AND GESTURE SUPPORT\nLike the Magic Mouse®, the Magic Trackpad® supports gestures to control the user interface. Apple introduced gestures as a simple way to control macOS from a Magic Trackpad or built-in trackpad of a MacBook®. To see what gestures are available on the Mac or to change any of the settings, go to System Preferences—-Trackpad.\n\n(https://4sorcero.s3.amazonaws.com/byteback/core_2/fig_core_2_118.png)\nConfiguring the trackpad.

macOS FEATURES\n\nIf you are using an Apple Mac computer for the first time, you will notice that the desktop and user interface is similar to a Windows-based PC in some respects but very different in others. As with Windows, a Mac boots to a graphical desktop environment. Any apps that have been installed and configured to launch at boot will also start.\n\nAt the top of the screen is the menu bar. This is always present with all apps, but the menu titles shown will vary between different software.\n\n(https://4sorcero.s3.amazonaws.com/byteback/core_2/fig_core_2_119a.png)\nMenu bars with different apps running. (Screenshot courtesy of Apple)\n\nTo the left of the menu bar is the Apple menu, represented by the Apple icon ® . The items are consistent on this menu for all apps. Some of the key menu items are:\n\n• About this Mac: Displays basic support information about the computer.\n\n(https://4sorcero.s3.amazonaws.com/byteback/core_2/fig_core_2_119b.png)\nAbout this Mac. (Screenshot courtesy of Apple.)\n\n• Displays: Shows the current display and its configuration. Click Displays Preferences to change the display resolution of the screen, to calibrate the color settings, or to AirPlay the display to a device such as an Apple TV.\n\n• Storage: Shows the capacity and current usage of the internal hard drive as well as any external drives that are connected to the Mac.\n\n* Service: If the computer is under warranty or is protected by the AppleCare Protection Plan, clicking on the relevant links will bring up more information about the available support options. If there is a significant fault with the computer and it is covered by warranty or AppleCare, it is recommended that you follow the instructions and obtain help and support through an Apple Authorized Service Provider.\n\nIn the top-right corner of the menu bar is the Status menu. This gives quick access to important key features of the computer.\n\n(https://4sorcero.s3.amazonaws.com/byteback/core_2/fig_core_2_120a.png)\nStatus menu options vary according to the software that is installed (from left to right: Dropbox, Adobe (Creative Cloud, Google Drive, Wacom Tablet, Evernote, Ring, Todoist, Skype, Arq, Skyfonts, Displays, Bluetooth, W-Fi, Drives, Keyboard Preferences and Day/Time). (Screenshot courtesy of Apple)\n\nTHE DOCK\nThe dock at the bottom of the screen gives one-click access to your favorite apps and files, similar to the taskbar in Windows. You can change the way the dock behaves—to configure autohide or position it at another edge of the screen—by right-clicking near the vertical line at the right of the dock.\n\n(https://4sorcero.s3.amazonaws.com/byteback/core_2/fig_core_2_120b.png)\nThe dock contains the Finder and Trash icons by default. (Screenshot courtesy of Apple)\n\nTo add a new app or file to the dock, click and drag the icon of the app/file into the dock. The Finder and Trash icons are always available in the dock. Apps that are open in the dock display a dot below the icon.\n\nRight-click any dock icon to change how that app/file behaves. In the options menu, you can remove that icon from the dock, select Open at login to start the app when. the computer boots, and Show in Finder to find the location of the target file.\n\nSPOTLIGHT SEARCH\nSpotlight Search can be used to find almost anything on macOS. To start a new search, click the magnifying glass in the menu bar or press Command Space to bring up the search box. You can change the document types that are searched in Preferences. If you wish to specifically exclude locations from Spotlight search, click the Privacy button to add a folder or drive to the excluded results.\n\nSYSTEM PREFERENCES\nThe System Preferences panel is the equivalent of the Windows Control Panel. It is the central "go-to" place for changing settings and network options, and optimizing a macOS configuration.\n\n(https://4sorcero.s3.amazonaws.com/byteback/core_2/fig_core_2_121.png)\nSystem Preferences. (Screenshot courtesy of Apple.)\n\nYou can access the System Preferences panel from the Apple menu, from the system Preferences icon in the dock, or by entering system preferences from Spotlight Search.\n\nNote: if you are not sure where you would change a specific option, just start typing its name in the search box. For example, typing password in the search box will highlight all the options where a password may be set.\n\nMISSION CONTROL AND MULTIPLE DESKTOPS\nIt is possible to configure macOS with multiple desktops (or spaces) using the\nMission Control feature. This enables the user to set up one or more desktops with different sets of apps, backgrounds, and so on, which is an easy way of managing tasks more effectively.\n\nTo set up a new desktop, activate Mission Control with the F3 key. At the top of the screen, it will display a small image of the current desktop with all the open apps below. Move your cursor to the top-right corner of this screen. A tab with a plus symbol will appear from the right. Click on it and a second desktop (Desktop 2; the original will have been renamed Desktop 1) will appear at the top. The open apps. shown will still be running on Desktop 1. If you want an app to only run on Desktop 2, click its window and drag it onto the Desktop 2 screen at the top.\n \n(https://4sorcero.s3.amazonaws.com/byteback/core_2/fig_core_2_122a.png)\nMission Control. (Screenshot courtesy of Apple)\n\nIt's possible to configure this further from the app menu in the dock. Right-click on an app and you will see the following menu:\n\n(https://4sorcero.s3.amazonaws.com/byteback/core_2/fig_core_2_122b.png)\nConfiguring Mission Control. (Screenshot courtesy of Apple)\n\nAs well as the standard options in the top half of this menu, you can choose to make an app available to all desktops, the currently displayed desktop, or no desktops at all.\n\nTo switch between desktops, press the F3 key and choose a desktop. Alternatively, press Control-left or Control-right to cycle between screens. You can also swipe left or right with three/four fingers on the trackpad, depending on how it is configured.\n\nTo remove a desktop, press F3 and hover the cursor over the desktop to be deleted, then click its Close icon. All apps associated with that (now deleted) desktop will revert to the main desktop.\ntag:C2 L2 TB

macOS FILE MANAGEMENT\n\nThe Finder is the macOS equivalent of Explorer in Windows. It lets the user navigate all the files and folders on a Mac. It is always present and open in the dock.\n\n(https://4sorcero.s3.amazonaws.com/byteback/core_2/fig_core_2_123a.png)\nThe Finder icon, (Screenshot courtesy of Apple.)\n\nWhen you first select Finder, it displays your most recently used files under Recents. Selecting one of the favorites in the sidebar will change that view. For example, selecting Applications will show the apps within that default macOS folder.\n\n(https://4sorcero.s3.amazonaws.com/byteback/core_2/fig_core_2_123b.png)\nFinder with Applications selected. (Screenshot courtesy of Apple.)\n\nHFS PLUS AND APFS\nWhere Windows uses NTFS and Linux typically uses ext3 or ext4, Apple Mac workstations and laptops use the Extended Hierarchical File System (HFS Plus). HFS Plus supports many of the same features as NTFS but cannot perform native file/folder encryption. The maximum volume and file size is 8 ExaBytes. The only reserved\ncharacters are : and /.\n\nIn macOS High Sierra and later, HFS Plus updated to the Apple File System (APFS), Which does support native file encryption. It also provides better support for SSDs. Upgrading to High Sierra (or later) automatically converts the startup volume from HFS Plus to APES if the disk is an SSD. Otherwise, the file system can be converted without data loss using the Disk Utility.\n\nNote: While data loss is not expected, always make a backup before performing this type of operation.\n\nOPTICAL DRIVES AND REMOTE DISC\nSince 2016, no Apple Mac has been sold with an internal optical drive. While an external USB drive can be used, another option is the Remote Disc app, which lets the user access a CD/DVD drive on another Mac or Windows computer. This isn’t suitable for audio CDs, DVD movies, recordable CDs/DVDs, or Windows installation disks, however.\n\nTo set up Remote Disc sharing on a Mac, open System Preferences~ Sharing then make sure the check box is ticked next to DVD or CD sharing To access the optical drive, click Remote Disc in Finder. The Mac with the drive that has just been configured will be displayed. Click its icon to access the drive.\n\niCloud\niCloud is Apple's online storage solution for its users. It provides a central, shared location for mail, contacts, calendar, photos, notes, reminders, and so on, across. macOS and iOS devices. By default, each user is provided with 5 GB of storage (at the time of writing), although itis possible to upgrade to more space for an additional monthly fee. This space is shared across all iCloud® components and devices.\n\nA keychain password cache can also be stored in iCloud to enable easy login to websites across macOS and iOS devices.\n\nTo manage iCloud, open icloud.com and sign in using an Apple ID. To see usage, click the user name in the top-right of the browser window and select Settings. This will show the amount of storage used and the devices that are linked to this account.\n \n(https://4sorcero.s3.amazonaws.com/byteback/core_2/fig_core_2_124.png)\nConfiguring iCloud. (Screenshot courtesy of Apple)\ntag:C2 L2 TB

macOS USERS AND PASSWORDS\n\nAn Administrator account and an optional Guest User account are created when macOS is installed, To add a new account, open System Preferences Users & Groups. Four types of account are available: Administrator, Standard, Managed with Parental Controls, and Sharing Only. The user's password can either be from iCloud or a separate password.\n\n• Administrator: This is the user type created when you set up your Mac computer. From this user, additional administrator users or other user types can be created An administrator user can convert users between standard and administrator user types. This user type should never be configured for automatic login as this could result in someone restarting the computer and gaining access to the user with administrator privileges.\n\n• Standard: This type of user can change their own settings, but not those of other users. They can also install apps for their own account. This user cannot create additional users or change the settings of other user accounts.\n\n• Managed with Parental Controls: The administrator specifies which apps and other content can be accessed by this user type. The websites that can be accessed can also be restricted by the administrator. In addition, time limits can be implemented for when the user can use the computer.\n\n• Sharing Only: This type of user is created to give someone permission to access your shared files or to share your screen. The user cannot log in to the computer and cannot make changes to any settings on the computer. In order to give someone sharing permission, configure settings in the Sharing preferences.\n\nAPPLE ID\nWhen first setting up an Apple Mac, the user will be assigned an Apple ID that is based on the sign-in email address. This Apple ID is used for purchases from the App Store, accessing iCloud and other functions. A user may already have an Apple ID from previous iTunes purchases or an iOS device.\n\nKEYCHAIN\nThe Keychain® in macOS helps you to manage passwords for websites and Wi networks. This feature is also available as iCloud Keychain, which makes the same passwords securely available across all macOS and iOS devices. The Keychain makes password management much easier, but occasionally problems can happen. If there are any problems, they will be identified by the Keychain Access app (in Utilities).\n\nIf warning messages are displayed, it's possible to attempt a repair with Keychain First Aid, Launch this from the Keychain Access menu. After entering an administrator password, select either Verify or Repair. If the problem persists, try resetting the Keychain itself. Select Keychain Access→ Preferences. Select Reset My Default Keychains to create a new empty keychain.\n\nIf you have forgotten a password, search for the website by typing into the search box. From the results, select the password that you want to view or change. Check the box for Show password and enter an administrator password to reveal the password for that device or service.\n\n(https://4sorcero.s3.amazonaws.com/byteback/core_2/fig_core_2_126a.png)\nKeychain Access tool. (Screenshot courtesy of Apple)\n\nIf other people have access to the Mac, it is wise to restrict access to the Keychain. To  do this, select the Keychain, then under the Edit menu, select Change settings for Keychain Name, where Nameis the Keychain selected.\n\n(https://4sorcero.s3.amazonaws.com/byteback/core_2/fig_core_2_126b.png)\nSecuring a Keychain.

macOS SOFTWARE MANAGEMENT\n\nThere are two main distribution mechanisms for macOS apps: the App Store and app downloads.\n\nAPP STORE\nMuch like the store for iOS devices, the App Store provides a central portal for Apple and developers to distribute free and paid-for software. It is also used to distribute updates to macOS and new releases of the operating system. The icon for the App Store is .\n\n(https://4sorcero.s3.amazonaws.com/byteback/core_2/fig_core_2_127a.png)\nApp Store, (Screenshot courtesy of Apple)\n\nDOWNLOAD APPS\nMicrosoft Office, Adobe® Creative Cloud®, and Skype® are just three examples of apps that are not available in the App Store. To install any of these apps, it is necessary to download them from the vendor site, ensuring that you select the macOS version. macOS download apps are normally distributed as .DMG (disk image) installer files. Follow the on-screen instructions to install the app. The last step will almost certainly ask you to copy the file to the Applications folder.\n\n(https://4sorcero.s3.amazonaws.com/byteback/core_2/fig_core_2_127b.png)\nDisk Image file. (Screenshot courtesy of Apple)\n\nBy default, macOS will only allow apps to be installed that have been downloaded from the Mac App Store. To allow the installation of download apps, go to System Preferences→Security & Privacy. Click the padlock to make changes to the settings— you will need to enter the Administrator password to continue.\n\nAlways use the installer package to remove apps that are no longer required.\n\nUpdates for apps that have been downloaded outside of the App Store are usually managed within the app itself. For example, Microsoft Office runs a regular auto-update to check for new versions and security updates.\n\nAPPLICATION COMPATIBILITY\nIf you need to use Mac OS 9 applications on an OS X/macOS system, you can do so in. the Classic environment. To use the Classic environment, you must have a Mac OS 9 system Folder installed on your computer, either on the same hard disk as macOS, or on another disk or disk partition.\n\nBOOT CAMP AND WINDOWS\nBoot Camp is a utility supplied with macOS that allows a full Windows installation to be made on a Mac. Once installed and Windows set up, the user has a choice of either operating system when booting the computer. In summary, the installation process for Windows on macOS is as follows:\n\n1. Ensure that the Apple Mac meets the system requirements for the version of Windows that is to be installed.\n\n2. Obtain an ISO disk image of Microsoft Windows.\n\n3. Run Boot Camp Assistant from the Applications—Utilities folder.\n\nNote: More comprehensive information about running Boot Camp Assistant can be {found at support.apple.com/HT201468.\n\n4. Follow the on-screen instructions to repartition the hard drive on the Mac.\n\n5. Format the new Windows partition and install Windows on it.\n\nTo boot into the Windows partition, press and hold the OPTION key as the Mac boots. Select the Windows partition from the Startup Manager.\n\nAPP CRASHES AND FORCE QUIT\nWhen an app is busy or processing a complex request, the spinning wait cursor will appear and usually disappear again within a few seconds. Should it remain visible for longer, it is possible that the app has gone into an endless loop or entered a state where it is not possible to complete its process.\n\nNote: The spinning wait cursor is also known as the spinning wheel, spinning pinwheel, and the spinning beach ball of death!\n\nIf a macOS app stops responding, it should be possible to close it down and restart without having to restart the computer. Run Force Quit from the Apple menu (always available in the Menu Bar) or press command+option+esc. You will probably need to switch into another app or window to be able to do this.\n\nSelect the app that isn’t responding—Mail in the example shown in the following figure—then click Force Quit to close it down.\n\n(https://4sorcero.s3.amazonaws.com/byteback/core_2/fig_core_2_129.png)\nUsing Force Quit to stop an app that is not responding.

It is always useful to report errors as they may point to an undocumented feature in macOS that needs to be addressed in a future update.\n\nTROUBLESHOOTING AN APP\nIf an app constantly crashes, take the following steps:\n\n• Ensure the latest version of the app is installed.\n\n• If the crash only happens with a specific document or file, try recreating that file from scratch in case it is corrupt.\n\n• Uninstall the app by dragging it to Trash and reinstall from either the App Store or the third-party vendor's site.\ntag:C2 L2 TB

macOS DIAGNOSTIC UTILITIES\n\nmacOS has several utilities that are provided as part of a default installation. You can find these utility apps in the Other folder in Launchpad, and in the Utilities folder under Applications.\n\nSYSTEM INFORMATION\nThe System Information app provides detailed diagnostic information about your Mac.\n\nSCREEN SHARING\nScreen Sharing allows another user to view your macOS desktop and operate the computer from another Apple Mac or a computer or device installed with VNC Viewer. Configure Screen Sharing via System Preferences→ Sharing. Enable screen sharing, then choose how users are authorized to connect. You can restrict access to specific Mac accounts or groups or a subset of those users as well as allow users to connect by requesting permission. VNC users can be configured to access the computer using a password. Connect to another macOS computer with screen sharing enabled by opening it via the Shared folder in Finder.\n\nACTIVITY MONITOR\nActivity Monitor is used to watch CPU, memory, energy, disk, and network usage. Use this app if you want to track unusual activity or patterns on the Mac and to try and establish if a specific app or process is causing overload of resources.\n\n(https://4sorcero.s3.amazonaws.com/byteback/core_2/fig_core_2_130.png)\nActivity Monitor.

macOS RECOVERY\n\nmacOS includes a set of utilities that you can use to restore a Mac from the Time Machine backup program, to reinstall macOS from a system image, or to reformat or repair the system disk.\n\nTo access the Recovery menu, as you power up the Apple Mac hold down the Command-R keys until you see the Apple logo. After selecting your language, it will boot into macOS Recovery, enabling you to select from the options shown in the following figure.\n\n(https://4sorcero.s3.amazonaws.com/byteback/core_2/fig_core_2_132.png)\nmacOS Recovery menu. (Screenshot courtesy of Apple)\n\nWhen you reboot an Apple Mac, if the startup drive is not available for any reason and it's connected to the Internet, the computer will try to boot from a web-based drive.\n\nUse a Time Machine snapshot backup if you want to restore the Mac to a specific point in time; for example, if you have replaced or reformatted the hard drive. Alternatively, if you have created a disk image (DMG) as a restore point, use the Disk Utility option to restore from that file. It's also possible to restore disk images from a web link.\ntag:C2 L2 TB

Topic C\nInstall and Upgrade Operating Systems\n\nEXAM OBJECTIVES COVERED\n1002-1.3 Summarize general OS installation considerations and upgrade methods.\n1002-1.4 Given a scenario, use appropriate Microsoft command-line tools.\n\nBeing able to install or upgrade an operating system can be important if you have built a custom computer system from scratch, if the system you purchased from a vendor did not have the correct system installed, or if you are completely redeploying existing hardware from one system to another.\n\nThe skills and information in this topic will help you plan and perform an OS installation properly, for whatever your technical and business requirements might be.\ntag:C2 L2 TC

OS INSTALLATION TYPES\n\nAn operating system installation copies the OS system and bundled application files from the installation media to a partition on the target computer's fixed disk. OS setup scans the computer for hardware devices and loads appropriate drivers. The user may be prompted for information about the computer name, network settings, and the primary user account.\n\nOS INSTALLATION OVERVIEW\nThe installation of an operating system should be carefully planned. It will consist of the following phases:\n\n1. Select an installation method—attended or unattended, and clean install or in-place upgrade, for example.\n\n2. Check compatibility—that the core components of the computer are sufficient to run the OS and that peripheral devices have drivers suitable for use with the OS. If upgrading, you also need to check application compatibility and establish the upgrade path.\n\n3. If upgrading, back up any existing user data or settings.\n\nThis is obviously not necessary if installing to a new computer, but is a vital step if you are replacing (rather than upgrading) an existing installation. While it takes more time, performance and reliability can be improved by performing a clean install.\n\nNote: you are performing an in-place upgrade, you should also make a full system backup before proceeding so that the upgrade can be rolled back should anything go wrong.\n\n4. Choose a boot method to use to load the OS setup files.\n\n5. Prepare the fixed disk and copy setup files to the target.\n\n6. Configure installation options.\n\n7. Verify installation—check logs and complete tests to confirm that installation has succeeded.\n\nATTENDED AND UNATTENDED INSTALLATIONS\nAn installation where the installer inputs the configuration information in response to prompts from a setup program is called an attended installation, whereas an installation that derives configuration information from a file designed for that purpose is called an unattended installation.\n\nCLEAN INSTALL OR IN-PLACE UPGRADE\nThere are two main approaches to performing an attended installation:\n\n• Clean install—means installing the OS to a new computer or completely replace the OS software on an old one. Any existing user data or settings would be deleted during the setup process.\n\n• In-place upgrade—means installing on top of an existing version of the OS, retaining applications, user settings, and data files.\n\nA clean install is generally seen as more reliable than upgrading. In a corporate network environment, installations are completed using images (a template containing the OS and required software) so that machines use a consistent set of software and configuration options. PC vendors also use images to install new systems for sale.\n\nUpgrades are generally designed for home users. Upgrade software can be purchased at a discount.\ntag:C2 L2 TC

COMPATIBILITY CONSIDERATIONS\n\nBefore you install or upgrade the OS on a computer, you must make sure that the computer hardware supports the new OS version. You may also need to check that any existing software applications will run under the new version.\n\nOS COMPATIBILITY/UPGRADE PATH\nIf you are considering upgrading, you must check that the current OS version is supported as an upgrade path to the intended version. The OS vendor should publish supported upgrade paths on their website. For example, the upgrade paths for Windows 10 are published here: docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/deployment/ upgrade/windows-10-upgrade-paths while the upgrade support documents for macOS are here: support.apple.com/macos/high-sierra.\n\nWith Windows, you also have to consider the edition when upgrading. You can usually upgrade to the same or higher edition (Windows 7 Home Premium to Windows 10 Home or Professional or Windows 10 Home to Windows 10 Professional, for instance), but you cannot upgrade from a home to an enterprise edition. Downgrading the edition is supported in some circumstances (Windows 7 Professional to Windows 10 Home, for instance) but this only retains documents and other data, not apps and settings. Downgrading from an Enterprise edition is not supported.\n\nNote that you can only upgrade the same type of operating system. You cannot “upgrade” from Windows to Linux, for instance.\n\nHARDWARE COMPATIBILITY AND APPLICATION COMPATIBILITY\nThe first step in checking hardware compatibility is to verify that the system exceeds the recommended requirements or prerequisites. The minimum requirements will not usually deliver adequate performance.\n\nThe second step is to verify that peripheral devices and expansion cards will work under the OS. Effectively this means, "Has the manufacturer released a stable driver for the OS?" Microsoft maintains a Windows Logo'd Product List (LPL) catalog, previously called the Hardware Compatibility List (HCL). This is a catalog of tested devices and drivers. If a device has not passed Windows logo testing, you should check the device vendor's website to confirm whether there is a driver available.\n\nIf you are performing an in-place upgrade or if you are planning a clean install and need to know whether you will be able to reinstall a particular app, you also need to check with each application vendor whether the new OS version is supported. In some cases, you may need to purchase an application upgrade, too.\n\nNote: You can sometimes use automated Upgrade Advisor software to check whether the existing computer hardware (and software applications) will be compatible with a new version of Windows. An Upgrade Advisor might be bundled with the setup program or available from the vendor website.\n\nUnsupported hardware or software can cause problems during an in-place upgrade and should be physically uninstalled from the PC. It is also worth obtaining the latest drivers for various devices from the vendor's website. The Windows setup media ships with default drivers for a number of products, but these are often not up-to-date nor are they comprehensive.\n\nNote: Store the latest drivers for your hardware on a USB drive or network location so that you can update hardware efficiently.\n\nLINUX INSTALLATION AND COMPATIBILITY\nThe hardware requirements for installing Linux will depend upon the distribution of Linux you choose. Linux is a portable operating system, which means it can run on a variety of hardware platforms. There are versions available for many different processor types, including Intel x86, Itanium, DEC Alpha, Sun Sparc, Motorola, and others. In general, a basic installation of Linux on a workstation might require as little as 16 or 32 MB of memory and 250 MB of disk space, but you might need several gigabytes of disk space for a complete installation, including all utilities.\n\nBecause Linux is a portable operating system, it is compatible with a wide range of hardware. You will need to check with the vendor or provider of your Linux distribution to verify if your particular system hardware is supported by that distribution.\n\nA site that works well for this is linux.com. They have a yearly comparison of the Linux distributions and what they feel are the best distributions for various purposes.\n\nSome web resources you can use to research general Linux hardware support include:\n\n• The Linux Hardware Compatibility HOWTO website at tldp.org/HOWTO/Hardware-HOWTO/index.html.\n\n• The Linux Questions website's hardware compatibility list at linuxquestions.org/hcl.\n\n• Linux hardware and driver support lists at linux-drivers.org.\n\nCheck your Linux vendor's website and read the technical documentation for the distribution of Linux you plan to install or upgrade to in order to determine if your existing applications will be supported under the new version.\ntag:C2 L2 TC

INSTALLATION BOOT METHODS\n\nThe installation boot method refers to the way in which the installation program and settings are loaded onto the PC. You may need to access the computer's firmware setup program to ensure that a particular boot method is available, enabled, and set to the highest priority.\n\n(https://4sorcero.s3.amazonaws.com/byteback/core_2/fig_core_2_137.png)\nConfiguring boot devices and priority in a computer's firmware setup program. (Screenshot courtesy of Hewlett-Packard, Inc)\n\nOPTICAL DISC (CD-ROM/DVD/BLU-RAY)\nMost attended installations and upgrades are run by booting from the setup CD-ROM or DVD. This might be listed as Optical Drive in the firmware setup program. You can also run a clean install or upgrade from an existing Windows installation.\n\nAn ISO file contains all of the contents from an optical disc in a single file. ISO files stored on removable media or a host system are often used to install virtual machine operating systems. An ISO file can be mounted to the file system as though it were a physical optical drive.\n\nEXTERNAL DRIVE/FLASH DRIVE (USB/ESATA)\nOne problem with disc-based installs is that the setup disc quickly becomes out-of-date and post-installation tasks for installing drivers, updates, and service packs can take longer than the original installation. One way around this is to build slipstreamed media, with all the various patches and drivers already applied. The media could be CD-ROM, DVD, or USB-attached flash drive or external drive connected by USB or by eSATA. The computer firmware must also support USB or eSATA as a boot method.\n\nNote: Microsoft provides a tool to create installation media from an ISO of the product setup files (support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/15088/windows-create-installation-media).\n\nNETWORK BOOT (PXE)\nA remote network installation means connecting to a shared folder containing the installation files (which could be slipstreamed). The target PC must have a usable partition on the hard disk in which to store temporary files. There also needs to be some means of booting with networking software. Most computers now come with a Preboot eXecution Environment (PXE) compliant firmware and network adapter, which supports booting from a network with a suitably configured server.\n\nNote: macOS supports a similar network boot method to PXE called NetBoot.\n\nINTERNAL FIXED DISK (HDD/SSD)/INTERNAL HARD DRIVE (PARTITION)\nOnce the OS has been installed, you will usually want to set the internal fixed disk (or the boot partition on the internal fixed disk) as the default (highest priority) boot device and disable any other boot devices. This ensures the system doesn't try to boot to the setup media again. If access to the firmware setup program is secured, it also prevents someone from trying to install a new OS without authorization.\n\nAn OS can be installed to a Hard Disk Drive (HDD) or Solid State Drive (SSD). Note that in the firmware setup program, the HDD will probably be on a SATA port while an SSD might be on a SATA, M.2, or PCIe port.\n\nThere may be some circumstances where you have to copy the installation media to the computer's fixed disk. To do this, you would remove the disk from the target PC and attach it to another machine. Use the other machine to partition the disk as appropriate and copy the setup files to it. Use the diskpart tool to set the partition as active. Use the bootsect tool to copy code to make the partition bootable. Finally, reinstall the disk to the target computer and boot to the partition containing your setup files.\n\nSECURE BOOT\nMotherboards now use a type of system firmware called Unified Extensible Firmware Interface (UEFI). In UEFI, there is an option called secure boot, which restricts OS installation to trusted software. This will prevent installation of Windows 7 and some distributions of Linux if enabled because the setup files for these operating systems are not digitally signed in a way that the firmware is able to trust.\n\n(https://4sorcero.s3.amazonaws.com/byteback/core_2/fig_core_2_139.png)\nConfiguring the Secure Boot option in the system firmware setup program. (Screenshot courtesy of Hewlett-Packard, Inc)\n\nAlso, a 32-bit edition of Windows needs to be installed in legacy BIOS mode. You can also choose to install using legacy BIOS mode if you do not want to use EFI boot for some reason.\n\nDISK FORMATTING AND PARTITIONING\n\nThe operating system must be installed to a partition that is of a suitable size and formatted with an appropriate file system. In Windows, the boot partition and system partition cannot be changed (except by using third-party tools), so it is important to plan the disk partition scheme in accordance with the way the computer will be used:\n\n• Will the computer have multiple operating systems installed (multiboot)? If so, it is best practice to create a partition for each OS.\n\n• Does the boot partition have spare capacity for growth? Running out of space will cause serious problems, so leave plenty of overhead.\n\nWindows must be installed to a boot partition formatted with NTFS.\n\n• Is some sort of hardware RAID being used? If so, the RAID utility must be used to configure the RAID level and create volumes before the OS can be installed. A RAID configuration utility is invoked by pressing a key combo such as Ctrl+F during startup (when the RAID firmware BIOS is processed).\n\n• Is an SSD or hybrid SSD being used? The SSD should be used for the boot partition as this will improve performance.\n\nNote: Remember that in Microsoft's terminology, the system partition is where the boot files are and the boot partition is where the operating system is installed.\n\nMULTIBOOT\nIf a user needs multiple operating systems, they can be set up on the same computer in a multiboot environment. Most operating systems can be run in this way, with the following caveats:\n\n• Each OS should be installed to a separate boot partition.\n\n• The system partition must be accessible to each OS. This means that, typically, must be formatted using FAT or FAT32).\n\n• New operating systems should not overwrite the boot manager. The general principle is to install the older operating system first, as an older OS is less likely to recognize a multiboot environment. Alternatively, the boot manager may need to be reconfigured manually following installation of an OS.\n\nMultiboot is seldom used anymore as virtualization represents a simpler way of achieving the same aim, with the major advantage that the different operating systems can be used concurrently.\n\nDISK FORMATTING\nThe easiest way to ensure a properly formatted boot drive with the correct partitions and format is to install to a blank hard disk. If you are using a disk with existing data that you do not want to keep, you can choose to delete existing partitions using the disk setup tool.\n \n(https://4sorcero.s3.amazonaws.com/byteback/core_2/fig_core_2_140.png)\nPartition layout for a GPT-style disk and Windows 10. (Screenshot used with permission from Microsoft)\n\nThe previous figure shows the typical partition layout for an OEM-formatted PC with UEFI-type firmware:\n\n• Disk 0 is a Solid State Drive (SSD) hosting the boot and system partitions. There are also two OEM partitions used for OS recovery and vendor diagnostic tools. The boot partition has been assigned drive letter C: and the other partitions have no drive letter.\n\n• Disk 1 is a second fixed disk. More accurately, it is a RAID volume comprising two mirrored HDDs, but because this is a hardware RAID, it appears as a single disk to the OS.\n\n• Disk 2 is a flash memory card reader and you can also see the optical disc drive.\n\n• All the partitions except the EFI system partition are formatted using NTFS. The Extensible Firmware Interface (EF!) system partition uses a type of FAT but isn’t listed as such in the drive management tool.\n\nBy contrast, the following screenshot shows the partitions created by the CentOS Linux setup tool if automatic partitioning is selected.\n\n(https://4sorcero.s3.amazonaws.com/byteback/core_2/fig_core_2_141.png)\nCentOS Linux default partitions.\n\nThe fixed disk is divided into three partitions: an EFI system partition, one for the Linux boot loader, and a Logical Volume Manager (LVM) partition. The LVM software is used to divide this last partition into three volumes (block devices)—one for the OS system files (root), one for a swap partition, and one for user data (home).\n\nOS SETUP DISK FORMATTING TOOLS\nWhile you can inspect and configure disks, partitions, and file systems using the Disk Management console once Windows is installed, a different tool is used from the Setup program to prepare the disk.\n\n(https://4sorcero.s3.amazonaws.com/byteback/core_2/fig_core_2_142.png)\nWindows disk setup options. (Screenshot used with permission from Microsoft.)\n\nIf you are performing a clean install but the target disk already has a partition structure, you can use the setup tool to delete the existing partitions. You can use the New button to create a custom partition structure or just select a disk with enough unallocated space and allow setup to create the required partitions automatically.\n\nLOADING DISK DRIVERS\nIn order to manage the hard disk, the setup program must have an appropriate driver for it. Most of the time the setup media will include a suitable driver. if you are installing to a RAID volume or to a computer with legacy firmware, itis possible that the disk or volume may not be recognized. If this is the case, you will have to load the disk or RAID vendor's driver via the Load Driver option on the Where do you want to install Windows dialog box in setup.\ntag:C2 L2 TC

LOCALE SETTINGS AND SOFTWARE SELECTION\n\nWhen you perform an attended installation, you need to manually configure setup at various points in the process. Windows setup is much better streamlined than in the past, with all the configuration options at the beginning and end of the process.\n\nNote: You are focusing on the Windows setup program here, but other operating systems present similar choices.\n\nThe first step in a Windows attended installation is to choose the language, regional format settings, time zone, and keyboard type. You should also check that the date and time are displayed correctly.\n\n(https://4sorcero.s3.amazonaws.com/byteback/core_2/fig_core_2_143.png)\nConfiguring the time zone during Windows 7 setup. (Screenshot used with permission from Microsoft)\n\nHaving done that, you can initialize setup by entering the product key, accepting the End User License Agreement (EULA), choosing the install type—upgrade or custom (clean install)—and partitioning and formatting the disk. Setup then proceeds without requiring any intervention. During this time, setup copies the OS files to the system folder, detects hardware devices, and loads appropriate drivers. Once this process is complete, the PC will restart.\n\nSOFTWARE SELECTIONS\nIn Windows setup, there is no opportunity to install additional software as such, though you can choose options such as linking the installation to a Microsoft user account and syncing files to OneDrive. When you install Linux, however, there is typically a setup option prompting you to select the type of installation and choose specific software packages to use.\n\n(https://4sorcero.s3.amazonaws.com/byteback/core_2/fig_core_2_144.png)\nSelecting a computer environment/role and software add-ons during CentOS setup.\ntag:C2 L2 TC

NETWORKING CONSIDERATIONS\n\nThere are some network-related things you will want to consider during installation.\n\nWINDOWS UPDATE\nIf the setup program detects that a network connection is present, it may present an option to use Windows Update to download the latest installation files from the Internet. If no Internet connection is available or you want to skip this step, you can use Windows Update after setup is complete.\n\nNote: In Windows 7, you could disable Windows Update automatic updating during setup if desired. This option is not available when installing Windows 10.\n\nWORKGROUP VS. DOMAIN SETUP\nA workgroup is a Microsoft peer-to-peer network model in which computers are grouped together with access to shared resources for organizational purposes. A domain is a Microsoft client/server network model that groups computers together for security and to centralize administration. Computers that are members of a domain have access to a shared central user account database, which means that an individual can use a single user account to log on at any computer within the domain.\n\nWindows does not support joining a domain during an attended installation, The computer can be joined by reconfiguring System properties in Control Panel, via the Settings interface, or can be joined during an unattended installation by using an answer file or script.\n\nThere is no option to change the default workgroup name (WORKGROUP) either. In Windows networking, the workgroup name is now entirely cosmetic.\n \nIn Windows 7, you are prompted to configure the computer's host name and choose a user name and password for the local administrator account. In Windows 8/10, you can choose to use a Microsoft account rather than creating a local account.\n\nIf the computer is not connected to the Internet, you will just be prompted to create a local account. You can convert a local account to a Microsoft account (or vice versa) using Windows Settings.\ntag:C2 L2 TC

POST-INSTALLATION TASKS\n\nWindows should detect all supported hardware and load the appropriate drivers during setup. When you have gotten to the final configuration screens, itis a good sign that the installation has succeeded. You might want to check the log files, check Device Manager to confirm all hardware has been recognized, and test each hardware device to verify functionality. You can use Programs and Features (in Control Panel) or the Microsoft Store to install any optional Windows components or third-party software applications.\n\nUpdate the system documentation with details of the installation. Keeping up-to-date documentation is important for system maintenance and troubleshooting.\n\nMICROSOFT PRODUCT ACTIVATION\nMicrosoft Product Activation or Volume Activation for Windows operating system is an antipiracy technology that verifies that software products are legitimately purchased, Product activation reduces a form of piracy known as casual copying, For example, you must activate the Windows operating systems within a given number of days after installation. After the grace period, users cannot access the system until they activate Windows. Volume Activation automates the activation process.\n\nFor individual installations of Windows, you can activate the installation over the Internet. If you do not have an Internet connection, you can activate over the phone, although this takes a little longer. If you wish, you can postpone product activation and activate later in the activation grace period.\n\nIn large organizations, you can use a Volume License Product Key, which eliminates the need to individually activate each installation of Windows. You can also activate Windows as part of an automated installation.\ntag:C2 L2 TC

REPAIR INSTALLATIONS\n\nif Windows computer will not boot or if you are troubleshooting a problem such as slow performance and cannot find a single cause, it may be necessary to perform some sort of "repair installation." There are several means of accomplishing this.\n\nNote: A repair install will only work if you are replacing the same version of the operating system; you cannot upgrade in this manner.\n\nFACTORY RECOVERY PARTITION\nA recovery disc or factory recovery partition (also called a Rescue Disk) is a tool used by OEMs to restore the OS environment to the same state on which it was shipped. The disc or recovery partition is used to boot the system, then a simple wizard-driven process replaces the damaged installation with an image stored on a separate partition on the hard disk. The recovery process can be started by pressing a key during startup (F11 or Ctrl+F11 are often used; a message is usually shown on-screen).\n\nOEM media will not usually recover user data or settings or applications installed— everything gets set back to the state in which the PC was shipped from the factory. User data should be recovered from backup, which obviously has to be made before the computer becomes unbootable.\n\nYou could also create recovery media manually or using backup software or drive imaging. In this scenario, you can create images that reflect all the software and service packs that a typical machine should include. Most backup suites have a simple wizard-driven routine for creating recovery media.\n\nThe advantages of using a recovery partition are that less time is required to re-build the machine and from a technical support point-of-view, recovery is much easier for end-users than re-installing Windows.\n\nThe main disadvantages with OEM recovery media are that the tool only works if the original hard disk is still installed in the machine and will not include patches or service packs applied between the ship date and recovery date. The recovery image also takes Up quite a lot of space and users may not feel that they are getting the hard disk capacity that they have paid for!\n\nNote: A recovery partition is not usually allocated a drive letter so will not be obvious to the user. You can make the partition visible to Explorer through the Disk Management program.\n\nREFRESH/RESTORE INSTALLATION\nAn in-place upgrade repair install is a “last gasp" method of restoring a Windows 7 installation that will not boot. The install process is run over the top of an existing installation. This can preserve some settings, application software installation, and data files while restoring system files. In Windows 8 and Windows 10, there are officially supported refresh and reset options to try to repair the installation. Using refresh (called Just remove my files in Windows 10) recopies the system files and reverts most system settings to the default, but can preserve user personalization settings, data files, and apps installed via Windows Store. Desktop applications are removed.\n\n(https://4sorcero.s3.amazonaws.com/byteback/core_2/fig_core_2_147.png)\nPerforming a repair installation of Windows 8. (Screenshot used with permission from Microsoft)\n\nUsing the Reset option (called Fully clean the drive) deletes the existing OS plus apps, settings, and data ready for the OS to be reinstalled.\ntag:C2 L2 TC

UNATTENDED INSTALLATIONS\n\nPerforming an attended installation is time-consuming, Although the setup process has been streamlined since the early versions of Windows, an attended installation still requires the installer to monitor the setup program and input information. When it comes to deploying large numbers of installations (whether at the same time or over a period of months), there are several options for completing fully or partially unattended installations. As with ordinary installs, these can be completed using a variety of media but most would be based on the remote network installation boot method (PXE).\n\nIMAGE DEPLOYMENT\nAny installation involving more than a few PCs makes using imaging technology worthwhile. An image is a clone of an existing installation stored in one file. The image can contain the base OS and configuration settings, service packs and updates, applications software, and whatever else is required. An image can be stored on DVD or USB media or can be accessed over a network.\n\nWindows supports the use of answer files, allowing for fully or partially unattended installations. An answer file is an extensible Markup Language (XML) text file that contains all of the instructions that the Windows Setup program will need to install and configure the OS without any administrator intervention.\n\nUsing unattended installation allows for multiple installations to occur simultaneously, can prevent errors during installation, and creates more consistency between installations in a large-scale rollout, all while lowering overhead costs and decreasing installation time and effort.\n\nWINDOWS SYSTEM IMAGE MANAGER\nThe Windows System Image Manager is used to configure answer files. An answer file contains the information input during setup, such as product key, disk partitions, computer name, language and network settings (including whether to join a domain or workgroup), and so on. This file is accessed automatically during setup, meaning that an installer does not have to be present. The System Image Manager is packaged with the Windows Assessment and Deployment Kit (ADK), formerly the Windows. Automated Installation Kit (WAIK), available from Microsoft's website.\n\n(https://4sorcero.s3.amazonaws.com/byteback/core_2/fig_core_2_148.png)\nWindows System Image Manager. (Screenshot used with permission from Microsoft)\n\nDRIVE CLONING AND SYSPREP\nIf Windows is to be deployed to multiple machines with similar hardware specifications, the most common method of deployment is to use disk imaging software to clone an installation from one PC (the reference machine) to the rest. This has the advantage that a full system can be built, including applications, service packs and patches, and default user settings.\n\nNote: You need different images for 32- and 64-bit platforms.\n\nMicrosoft's Deployment Image Servicing and Management tool (dism, part of the ADK) is used to duplicate the disk contents. Dism reads the contents of a drive and writes the output to a .WIM (Windows Image File) format file.\n\nHowever, duplicating an existing installation exactly can cause problems, as it repeats the Security ID (SID; a unique identifier for each machine) and assumes that the machines have exactly the same hardware configuration, which may not be the case.\n\nMicrosoft's System Preparation Tool (Sysprep) utility should be run before imaging the disk to side-step these problems. You can run the tool from %SystemRoot%\system32\sysprep\sysprep.exe.\n\n(https://4sorcero.s3.amazonaws.com/byteback/core_2/fig_core_2_149.png)\nResealing your computer using sysprep. (Screenshot used with permission from Microsoft.)\n\nNote: The Sysprep utility has gone through several updates with different Windows versions and service packs.\n\nWINDOWS DEPLOYMENT SERVICES\nA basic network installation can be set up by putting the installation files in a network share, booting the machine to the network, then accessing the installation program from the share.\n\nWindows Deployment Services is a Windows Server component used to implement network installs more effectively for .WIM images and answer files.\n\nTo support network deployments, clients must have a PXE compatible firmware and network adapter.\ntag:C2 L2 TC

Activity 2-4\nDiscussing OS Installation\n\nSCENARIO\nAnswer the following questions to check your understanding of the topic.\n\n1. When should you use FAT32 for the system partition?\n\n2. If you want to use PXE as an installation method, what type of compatible\ncomponent would you require?\n\n3. What is the advantage of using a USB thumb drive to install Windows?\n\n4, What is a recovery partition?\n\n5. What should you configure in order to perform an unattended installation?\n\n6. What is meant by disk imaging?\n\n7. How would you configure a PC to join a domain during installation of Windows 7?\ntag:C2 L2 TC A2-4

Activity 2-5\nDeploying a Windows Image\n\nBEFORE YOU BEGIN\nComplete this activity using Hyper-V Manager and the PC1 (Windows 10) VM.\n\nYou normally create answer files by using the Windows System Image Manager. As that process is quite complex, there is an answer file supplied for use in this activity.\n\nSCENARIO\nWhen you want to deploy Windows to multiple workstations, you will usually image a reference system containing all the system updates, applications, and Windows features that you want to use on each workstation. Before you can use the reference system as an image, however, you need to run the SYSPrep utility so that Windows generates a new unique system ID when installed to a new workstation. In this activity, you will practice performing a Windows unattended installation by using an image and answer file.\n\n1. On the PC1 VM, examine the contents of the answer file in C\LABFILES\unattend.xml.\n\n(https://4sorcero.s3.amazonaws.com/byteback/core_2/fig_core_2_151.png)\nThis answer file was created by using Windows System Image Manager. (Screenshot used with permission from Microsoft)\n\na) Start PC1, and sign on to the Admin account with the Pag$wOrd credential.\n\nb) Open File Explorer and browse to C\LABLFILES.\n\nc) Right-click the Unattend file, and select Edit with Notepad++.\n\nd) Identify some of the features of this answer file.\n\n(https://4sorcero.s3.amazonaws.com/byteback/core_2/fig_core_2_152.png)\n \n• The answer file configures only single setup pass, called OOBE (Out-of-Box Experience). tis possible to configure settings for every part of setup, including disk partitioning and formatting, but you do not need to do this for your reference system.\n\n• The first component in the answer file sets the values for system and input locale.\n\n• There is a section that creates a new user account named Sam. The password for tthe account is hashed (the plain text value is Pa$$w0rd). The account is added to the Administrators security group.\n\n• The final section skips the configuration screens so that no user input is required.\n\ne) Close Notepad++\n\n2. Check the current machine SID, and then run SYSpr ep. You can use one of the utilities in the Sysinternals suite of Windows tools to return the machine's SID.\n\na) Open a command prompt and run the following command:\n\nc:\labfiles\sysinternals\psgetsid -accepteula\n\nThis returns the SID of the local machine (host name PC1).\n\nb) Write down the SID:\n\nc) Run the following command (ignore any line breaks that may be present in printing and issue this as a single command):\n\nc:\Wndows\Systen32\Sysprep\Sysprep.exe /generalize /oobe /reboot /unattend: c:\labfiles \unattend.xml\n\nSysprep will spend some minutes reconfiguring the system. The VM will reboot several times.\n\nNote: When you select reboot mode, you are applying the setup changes back to the same disk. Normally, you would shut down the VM and then duplicate the disk image to another VM. Sysprep would then run mini setup when that new VM was first booted.\n\nd) When setup is complete, select the Sam user account, and sign in with the password Pa$$w0rd.\n\ne) When the profile has been set up and the desktop loads, open a command prompt and run psgetsid again to verify that the SID and computer name have changed.\n\n3. At the end of each activity, you need to close the VM. You will always discard any changes you made.\n\na) From the connection window, select Action→Revert.\n\nb) If you are prompted to confirm, select the Revert button.\ntag:C2 L2 TC A2-5
 
Topic D\nMaintain OSs\n\nEXAM OBJECTIVES COVERED\n1002-1.3 Summarize general OS installation considerations and upgrade methods.\n1002-1.4 Given a scenario, use appropriate Microsoft command-line tools.\n1002-1.5 Given a scenario, use Microsoft operating system features and tools.\n1002-1.9 Given a scenario, use features and tools of the Mac OS and Linux client/desktop operating systems.\n\nOnce you have installed the OS, you need to maintain it on an ongoing basis and set up some basic preventive maintenance procedures to keep the computer working well. Maintaining an OS might not seem as exciting or interesting as performing a new installation or replacing a hard disk, but itis actually one of the most crucial tasks for a support technician. System maintenance is important for two reasons: first, proper maintenance can prevent system problems from arising. Second, proper maintenance of the system, including the creation of appropriate backups, can make recovery or troubleshooting operations much easier. As a CompTIA A+ technician, you can use the skills and information in this lesson to perform preventive maintenance as part of your ongoing job tasks.\ntag:C2 L2 TD

DISK MAINTENANCE\n\nOf all the computer's subsystems, disk drives and the file system probably require the most attention to keep in optimum working order. They are subject to three main problems:\n\n• Fragmentation—ideally, each file would be saved in contiguous clusters on the disk. In practice, over time as files grow, they become fragmented (written to non-contiguous clusters), reducing read performance.\n\n• Capacity—typically, much more file creation occurs on a computer than file deletion. This means that capacity can reduce over time, often quite quickly. If the system disk has less than 20% free space, performance can be impaired. When space drops below 200 MB, a Low Disk Space warning is generated.\n\n• Damage—hard disk operations are physically intensive and the platters of the disk are easy to damage, especially if there is a power cut. If the disk does not recognize that a sector is damaged, files can become corrupted.\n\nThese problems can be addressed by the systematic use of disk performance tools. These tools should be run regularly—at least every month and before installing software applications.\n\nIn Windows, you can access tools to maintain and optimize a drive through the drive's, properties dialog box (right-click the drive icon and select Properties).\ntag:C2 L2 TD

WINDOWS DISK MAINTENANCE TOOLS\n\nThere are several tools that you will find helpful when it comes to performing disk maintenance in Windows.\n\nCHECK DISK\nThe Check Disk (chkdsk) Windows utility checks the integrity of disks and can repair any problems detected. Scheduling a check disk to run regularly will keep errors from accumulating on the hard disk. It is recommended that you run the Check Disk utility weekly.\n\n(https://4sorcero.s3.amazonaws.com/byteback/core_2/fig_core_2_155.png)\nThe Check Disk utility in Windows 7. (Screenshot used with permission from Microsoft.)\n\nThere are three ways to run the tool:\n\n• No option selected—runs in Read-Only mode.\n\n• Automatically fix fle system errors—file system errors are caused by crashes, power loss, and the like. At a command line, use chkdsk volume: /f,where volume is the drive letter.\n\n• Scan for and attempt recovery of bad sectors—bad sectors are damage to the actual drive. If a drive has many bad sectors, it is probably nearing the end of its useful life. You are prompted to save any recoverable data, which is copied to the root directory as filennnn.chk files. Ata command line, use chkdsk volume: /r, where volume is the drive letter.\n\nNote: Note that /r implies /f so you do not need to use both switches.\n\nCheck Disk cannot fix open files, so you may be prompted to schedule the scan for the next system restart. A version of Check Disk (autochk) will also run automatically if the system detects file system errors. The other main parameters and switches for the command-line version are as follow:\n\n(https://4sorcero.s3.amazonaws.com/byteback/core_2/table_core_2_155.png)\n\npath Specify a path (and optionally file name) to check.\n\n/x Force the volume to dismount. This will cause file errors for users with files open on the volume. If the volume is in use and you use the /r or /x switches without /x, you are prompted to schedule chkdsk for the next system restart.\n\n/i /c  On NTFS volumes only, skips parts of the checking process.\n\nNote: chkdsk can take a long time to scan and fix errors on a large disk. You cannot cancel once started. Run a Read-Only scan first.\n\nDISK DEFRAGMENTER\nIn Windows, the Disk Defragmenter reorganizes a drive to store information relating to each file in contiguous sectors of the disk. This improves performance by reducing  the time required to load a file. The Disk Defragmenter can also move data to the start of the disk, leaving a single free area of disk for use by new files.\n\n(https://4sorcero.s3.amazonaws.com/byteback/core_2/fig_core_2_156.png)\nOptimize Drives (Defragmenter) in Windows 10. (Screenshot used with permission from Microsoft.)\n\nIn Windows 8/10, the GUI tool is named Optimize Drives. It performs additional disk and file system improvements compared to the basic utility.\n\nYou can defragment local and external hard disks. You cannot defragment an optical disc or a network drive.\n\nNote: With flash drives and SSDs, while seek time is not a performance factor, the file system does still benefit from defragmentation. You can read more about the technical considerations in optimizing SSDs at hanselman.com/blog/TheRealAndCompleteStoryDoesWindowsDefragmentYourSSD.aspx.\n\nAlthough it is possible to run this utility in the background while you work, it will slow your machine and prevent defragmentation of open files. Itis usually better to run defragmenter when your computer is not being used.\n\nNote: The Defragmenter requires above 15% of fee disk space to work effectively. If insufficient fee disk space is available, some files may not be defragmented.\n\nWindows automatically schedules Defragmenter to run using Task Scheduler.\n\nNote: Windows Task Scheduler is discussed in greater detail later in this topic.\ntag:C2 L2 TD

LINUX AND macOS DISK MAINTENANCE TOOLS.\n\nThe file systems used by Linux and macOS (ext and HFS Plus/APFS) are less prone to fragmentation than NTFS. Regular use of disk maintenance utilities is still considered best practice, however.\n\nLINUX DISK MANAGEMENT TOOLS\nLinux file systems do not ordinarily require defragmenting. Linux leaves gaps between ac file, allowing the files to grow or shrink within their own "space," avoiding the worst effects of fragmentation. Performance will suffer if the disk is more than 80% full, however. You can use the following tools to check the health of the disk and file system:\n\n• df and du—check free space and report usage by directories and files.\n\n• fsck—check a partition for errors. Note that the partition should be unmounted before running this tool.\n\nNote: Most systems automatically run the fsck command at boot time so that errors, if any, are detected and corrected before the system is used.\n\nmacOS DISK UTILITY\nIn macOS, the Disk Utility app can be used to verify or repair a disk or file system. It can also be used to erase a disk with security options in case you are selling or passing on a Mac.\n\n(https://4sorcero.s3.amazonaws.com/byteback/core_2/fig_core_2_157.png)\nDisk utility. (Screenshot courtesy of Apple.)\n\nAs with Linux, there is no need to regularly defragment a Mac hard drive. It's possible to run a defragmentation, but it should only be needed very rarely.\ntag:C2 L2 TD

PATCH MANAGEMENT\n\nPatch management is an important maintenance task to ensure that PCs operate reliably and securely. A patch or update is a file containing replacement system or application code, The replacement file fixes some sort of coding problem in the original file. The fix could be made to improve reliability, security, or performance.\n\nPatch management is the practice of monitoring, obtaining, evaluating, testing, and deploying fixes and updates. As the number of computer systems in use has grown over recent years, so has the volume of vulnerabilities and corresponding patches and updates intended to address those vulnerabilities. However, not every computer within an organization will necessarily be compatible with a certain patch, whether because of outdated hardware, different software versions, or application dependencies.\n\nBecause of the inconsistencies that may be present within the various systems, the task of managing and applying patches can become very time-consuming and inefficient without an organized patch management system. In typical patch management, software updates are evaluated for their applicability to an environment and then tested in a safe way on non-production systems. If the patch is validated on all possible configurations without causing more problems, only then will the valid patch be rolled out to all computers throughout the entire organization.\n\nA patch management program might include:\n\n• An individual responsible for subscribing to and reviewing vendor and security patches and updating newsletters.\n\n• A review and triage of the updates into urgent, important, and non-critical categories.\n\n• An offline patch test environment where urgent and important patches can be installed and tested for functionality and impact.\n\n• Immediate administrative push delivery of approved urgent patches,\n\n• Weekly administrative push delivery of approved important patches.\n\n• A periodic evaluation phase and full rollout for non-critical patches.\n\nMany organizations have taken to creating official patch management policies that define the who, what, where, when, why, and how of patch management for that organization.\ntag:C2 L2 TD

OS UPDATES\n\nWhile working within patch management procedures, you also need to know the processes involved in performing updates in different operating systems.\n\nWINDOWS UPDATE\nWindows Update is a website (update.microsoft.com) hosting maintenance updates for different versions of Microsoft Windows. A control installed on the computer enables it to browse the site and select updates for download and installation, using the Background Intelligent Transfer Services (BITS) protocol.\n\nNote: Unless they address a critical issue, updates are released on Patch Tuesday (the second Tuesday of every month).\n\nWindows Update hosts critical updates and security patches (code to fix security vulnerabilities in Windows and its associated software) plus optional software and hardware updates to add or change features or drivers. There is also a complementary program, called Microsoft Update, which can be used to keep Microsoft Office software patched at the same time.\n\n(https://4sorcero.s3.amazonaws.com/byteback/core_2/fig_core_2_159a.png)\nWindows Update (Windows 7). (Screenshot used with permission from Microsoft)\n\nNote: Hotfixes are released to fix problems being experienced in specific circumstances. They are not always available through Windows Update but can be requested via the Microsoft Knowledge Base article describing the problem.\n\nDuring setup, Windows can be configured to check for system updates (via the Internet) and download them as needed. Update settings can be reconfigured via the Windows Update applet in Control Panel.\n\n(https://4sorcero.s3.amazonaws.com/byteback/core_2/fig_core_2_159b.png)\nChanging update settings in Windows 7. (Screenshot used with permission from Microsoft)\n\nIn Windows 10, you can also check for updates via Windows Settings—-Update & Security. Note that, in the basic interface, Windows Update can only be disabled temporarily in Windows 10.\n\nYou can choose which updates to apply and also configure update settings.\n\nThe WindowsUpdate.txt log (stored in the %SystemRoot% folder) records update activity. If an update fails to install, you should check the log to find the cause; the update will fail with an error code that you can look up on the Microsoft Knowledge Base.\n\nIf an update causes problems, you can use the Programs and Features applet to uninstall it. Note, however, that %SystemRoot% also contains KB: xt log files listing which updates have been installed and hidden uninstall folders for the updates (SNtUninstallkB7?7772S). If these folders are deleted, the updates cannot be uninstalled,\n\nNote: To check the current build of Windows, run winver. To check the version number of a particular file, right-click and select Properties.\n\nOn a corporate network, updates can also be served using a Windows Server Update Services (WSUS) server. This allows the network administrator to approve updates for selected computer groups.\n\nAPPLICATION UPDATES\nSoftware applications (especially those with browser plug-ins) may also need updating with the latest patches. Applications can contain security vulnerabilities in the same way as the OS; in fact, applications are targeted more aggressively than Windows itself as attackers recognize that they are less likely to be patched than the OS.\n\nMicrosoft software (such as MS Office) can be updated via the same update interface by selecting Give me updates for other Microsoft products when | update Windows. Most third-party vendors install autoupdate software with their applications.\n\nLINUX PACKAGE MANAGEMENT\nTo manage updates and software in Linux, the package manager (such as yum or apt get) needs to be configured with the web address of the software repository (or repositories) that you want to use. It can then be used to install, uninstall, or update the software.\n\n(https://4sorcero.s3.amazonaws.com/byteback/core_2/fig_core_2_161a.png)\nConfiguring package manager sources in Ubuntu Linux.\n\nMost Linux software is configured by editing one or more text files with the required parameters, though some software may provide a GUI front-end.\n\nUpdates to the Linux kernel and drivers and a distribution's software tools and applications can be obtained via the package manager.\n\nFor example, you can edit a configuration file in the unattended-packages package to allow apt to obtain different types of updates. In the following example, only security updates are being obtained—the other types are commented out.\n\n(https://4sorcero.s3.amazonaws.com/byteback/core_2/fig_core_2_161b.png)\nConfiguring update types.\n\nHaving configured automatic updates, another configuration file sets options for the frequency of updates, cleaning out temporary files, and so on. Finally, you would use an executable update task for scheduling by the cron tool\n\n(https://4sorcero.s3.amazonaws.com/byteback/core_2/fig_core_2_162a.png)\nThe apt script runs as a daily task to install updates as per the configuration files. \n\nmacOS PATCH MANAGEMENT\nIn macOS, the App Store checks daily for new updates and releases of installed apps. If a new version is available, a notification will be shown against the App Store icon in the dock. Also when you open the App Store, it will highlight that updates are available against the Updates button in the App Store window menu bar. To update the app, run App Store and click the Updates button in the top bar of the window.\n\n(https://4sorcero.s3.amazonaws.com/byteback/core_2/fig_core_2_162b.png)\nConfiguring automatic updates. (Screenshot courtesy of Apple.)\n\nYou will have a choice to either update the apps individually or update all from the button at the top. It is recommended to choose Update All so that the latest versions of your apps and updates to macOS (not necessarily new versions) are on the Mac. It is also possible to automatically update apps to the latest version. To do this, go to APP Store→Preferences and configure the appropriate settings:\n\nMost apps that are downloaded and installed from a third-party developer will automatically check if updates are available each time they are run. A prompt will be displayed to update or to cancel. It's also possible to manually check for updates using the Check for Updates menu option in the app itself.\n\nANTI-MALWARE UPDATES\n(On any Windows system, it is particularly important that anti-virus software (or any other type of malware-blocking software) be updated regularly. Two types of update are generally necessary:\n\n• Virus definitions/patterns—this is information about new viruses. These updates may be made available daily or even hourly.\n\n• Scan engine/components—this fixes problems or makes improvements to the scan software itself.\n\n(https://4sorcero.s3.amazonaws.com/byteback/core_2/fig_core_2_163.png)\nSchedule regular virus definition and scan engine updates. (Screenshot used with permission from Microsoft)\n\nThere is usually an option within the software program to download and install these updates automatically. In the example in the previous figure, note the options to retry and randomize the start time—this helps to ensure that an update will take place.\n\nLINUX AND VIRUSES/ MALWARE\nSome people feel that virus detection is unnecessary for Linux when used as a desktop PC OS. The way the Linux operating system is built (and the fact that there are many distributions) means that unlike Windows, it is harder to write a virus that will affect every Linux system, Different command-line/graphical shells, a simpler security system, and software package managers with authorized software repositories all mean that a virus writer has a harder job to infect a Linux system.\n\nThis does not mean that Linux is risk-free, however, and each installation should be assessed for security controls to suit the use to which it is put. Any high value target could be subject to specific, targeted attacks against it. Where Linux is used as the platform for a web server, for instance, it is imperative to configure appropriate security controls. Products such as Clam Anti-Virus (ClamAV) and the Snort Intrusion Prevention System (IPS) can be used to block varied malware threats and attempts to counteract security systems. Though now owned by Cisco, both ClamAV and Snort are open source products made freely available under the General Public License (GPL). Another scenario for installing Linux anti-malware software is to detect infected files, and prevent onward transmission via email or file transfer to Windows-based systems.\n\nmacOS AND VIRUSES/MALWARE\nLike any other software, macOS is subject to numerous vulnerabilities and security advisories, some of which can be exploited and are serious enough to an unprivileged user to obtain root access. It is imperative to patch macOS systems against known vulnerabilities. There are relatively few instances of the infection of macOS systems by conventional computer viruses or worms. However, this does not mean that new threats will not appear in the future. Also, macOS is vulnerable to different kinds of malware, such as fake A/V and Trojans. Also, a macOS host could pass on Windows viruses to other users via email or file transfer. If a Windows boot partition is installed on macOS, it's possible for the Windows installation to become infected with a virus.\n\nThe following steps can help to protect a macOS computer from infection:\n\n• Only download trusted apps—by default, macOS will only allow apps to be installed that have been downloaded from the App Store. If this setting is changed, ensure that you only download apps and content from trusted websites.\n\n• Only download trusted content—again, make sure that you only download media or other content from reliable, trusted sources.\n\n• Use anti-virus software—a number of free A-V packages are available for the Mac (from Avira, Avast, and Sophos for instance) that will detect malware directed at macOS—and Windows viruses too—and prevent redistribution via email or file sharing.\n\n• If you have a bootable Windows partition on your macOS installation (Boot Camp), it is essential to treat it as if you were running and managing a Windows computer.\n\nAny anti-virus package can be used; make sure you follow the same processes and procedures to protect Windows as if it were a standalone computer.\n\n(https://4sorcero.s3.amazonaws.com/byteback/core_2/fig_core_2_165.png)\nSecurity and Privacy settings. (Screenshot courtesy of Apple.)\n\nDRIVER AND FIRMWARE UPDATES\nWindows ships with a number of core and third-party device drivers for system components and peripheral hardware. Updates for these devices can be obtained via Windows Update, though they will be listed as optional updates and might not install automatically.\n\nYou might need to use the device vendor's website to obtain a driver. To update, you download the driver files and install them using the supplied setup program or extract them manually and save them to a local folder. You can then use the device's property dialog box in Device Manager to update the driver. You can either scan for the update automatically or point the tool to the updated version you saved locally.\n\nFIRMWARE UPGRADES\nMotherboard manufacturers may update their system firmware in order to fix bugs, solve incompatible with operating systems, or to add new features. You should visit your motherboard manufacturer's website regularly to check if and when upgrades are available.\n\nAs well as the chipset firmware, you may need to update the firmware on other devices, such as drive units, printers, and networking equipment. Devices directly attached to the PC (via USB) can normally be updated from Windows using a setup utility provided by the vendor. A network device would typically be updated using its management software or web configuration interface.\n\nCaution: interrupting a firmware update can damage a device beyond repair. Try to censure a stable power supply during the update process, using an Uninterruptible Power Supply (UPS) if possible.\n\nmacOS DRIVER UPDATES\nUnlike Windows-based PCs, where desktops are made from various hardware components from different manufacturers, each requiring its own driver, Apple's integrated approach to system building means that drivers are easier to manage. All drivers for display, network interfaces, drives, and so on, are integral to macOS and will be updated (where necessary) either through software updates through the App Store or even new releases of macOS itself.\n\nWhere third-party devices are installed, always make sure that the latest version of the driver is installed. Use the About button from the device's page in System Preferences to verify the current driver version.\n\n(https://4sorcero.s3.amazonaws.com/byteback/core_2/fig_core_2_166.png)\nDriver information for this Wacom graphics tablet is accessed via the About option in System Preferences.\n\nCheck the manufacturer's website to see if this is the latest version. If installing a new driver, first remove the old driver from macOS. In the example in the previous figure, you would use the Wacom Utility under Applications, then click Remove under Tablet Software to delete the driver and utilities. You may be prompted to enter an administrator password to do this.\n\nNext, download the latest version from the manufacturer website. This will almost certainly take the form of a .dmg disk image. Double-click the package and follow the instructions to install the driver. Complete the process by verifying the updated version number is shown via System Preferences.\n\nNote: Always remember to remove the old version of a third-party driver before updating.\ntag:C2 L2 TD

SCHEDULED BACKUPS\n\nOne of the most important operations in computing is the creation of a secure backup of data files. Typically, network backups take place using a tape system, which has the advantages of high capacity, relatively low cost, and portability. For this type of backup, advanced backup software capable of backing up online databases and remote systems is required. Most large organizations will implement a structured backup scheme that includes a backup schedule and specifications for which files are backed up, where the backup is stored, and how it can be retrieved, The backup scheme will specify the media rotation method, which determines how many backup tapes or other media sets are needed, and the sequence in which they are used and reused. Designated administrators will have the responsibility for designing and managing the backup scheme and for restoring data when needed.\n\nNote: When a computer is connected to a network, it is bad practice for a user to store data locally (on the client PC's hard drive). Network home folders and the use of scripts to copy data can help users to transfer data to a file server, where it can be backed up safely.\n\nPersonal backups are necessary for home users or on workgroups, where no central file server is available. In this scenario, the backup software supplied with Windows is serviceable. Most home users will backup to external hard drives or use some sort of cloud-based storage.\n\nWINDOWS BACKUP\nThe backup tool included with Windows 7 has the ability to back up selected locations. The home editions are restricted to backing up to local drives or removable media, whereas the business/Ultimate editions can back up to a network share.\n\n(https://4sorcero.s3.amazonaws.com/byteback/core_2/fig_core_2_167.png)\nWindows 7 Backup and Restore Center. (Screenshot used with permission from Microsoft)\n\nIn Windows 8 and Windows 10, user data backup options are implemented via File History. To configure the backup device and select folders to back up, select Settings→Update & security→Backup.\n\n(https://4sorcero.s3.amazonaws.com/byteback/core_2/fig_core_2_168a.png)\nConfiguring backup options via Windows Settings. (Screenshot used with permission from Microsoft)\n\nIf you need to restore a file or folder, you can either check the Previous Versions tab in the object's Properties dialog box or use the File History applet.\n\n(https://4sorcero.s3.amazonaws.com/byteback/core_2/fig_core_2_168b.png)\nRedirecting file output for a restore operation. (Screenshot used with permission from Microsoft)\n\nmacOS TIME MACHINE BACKUP\nIn macOS, the Time Machine utility enables data to be backed up to an external, attached drive. To enable Time Machine, go to System Preferences→ Time Machine and slide the switch to On, Select the disk where the backups are to be stored. Under Options it is possible to unselect certain files, folders, or even drives from a backup plan, By default, Time Machine keeps hourly backups for the past 24 hours, daily backups for a month, and weekly backups for all | previous months. When the drive used to store backups becomes full, Time Machine removes older backups to free up space.\n\n(https://4sorcero.s3.amazonaws.com/byteback/core_2/fig_core_2_169.png)\nConfiguring Time Machine. (Screenshot courtesy of Apple.)\n\nTo restore files from Time Machine, a timeline on the right-hand side of the screen will show the available backups. Using the Finder window in Time Machine, find the folder with file (oF files) that you want to restore. Then slide the timeline back to the datetime of the previous version.\n\nNote: Time Machine stores backups on the local drive as snapshots as well as any available backup drive. If the backup drive is not attached, you may still be able to restore a file or version from the local snapshot. If the tick mark next to an item in the timeline is dimmed, the backup drive needs to be attached to restore that item.\n\nLINUX BACKUP TOOLS\nLinux does not have an “official” backup tool. You could create a custom backup solution using the cron task scheduler (see the following section) and file copy scripts. There are plenty of commercial and open source backup products for Linux, however. Some examples include Amanda, Bacula, Fwbackups, and Rsync.\ntag:C2 L2 TD

TASK SCHEDULERS\n\nWhile you might establish procedures for performing the maintenance tasks discussed previously, you might also want the tasks to run automatically within the OS. To accomplish this, you can use a task scheduler.\n\nWINDOWS TASK SCHEDULER\nTask Scheduler, as its name suggests, is a Windows tool that sets tasks to run at a particular time. Tasks can be run once at a future date or time or according to a recurring schedule. A task can be a simple application process (including switches, if necessary) or a batch file or script. Task Scheduler is accessed via Administrative Tools. Apart from defining the path to the file or script you want to execute and setting the schedule, you should also enter the credentials that the task will run under—if the selected user account does not have sufficient permissions, the task will not run.\n\nMany of Windows’ processes come with predefined task schedules. Disk Defragmenter/Optimize Drives, for instance, is configured to run automatically by default. Other features include:\n\n• You can define triggers other than a simple schedule—running a task when the machine wakes from sleep or hibernation, for instance.\n\n• You can add multiple actions under a single task.\n\n• You can view a log of events connected to the task.\n\n• You can organize tasks folders and there are more tools for managing them.\n\n(https://4sorcero.s3.amazonaws.com/byteback/core_2/fig_core_2_170.png)\nWindows 7 Task Scheduler. (Screenshot used with permission from Microsoft)\n\ncron\nIn Linux, if you want to run a batch of commands or a script to perform a backup or other maintenance task, there is a scheduling service called cron. Every user of the system is allowed to schedule programs or tasks in their own personal crontab (cron table). These tables are merged together by cron to create an overall system schedule. Every minute, the eran service checks the schedule and executes the programs for that time period.\n\nTo add or delete a scheduled job, use the crontab editor. To review a user's crontab jobs, enter the command: crontab -l.\n\nTo remove jobs from the scheduled list, use the command: crontab - r\n\nTo enter the editor, run the command crontab -e. crontab uses the vi editor by default. To add a new job, press the Insert key then type a new job using the appropriate syntax. After the job syntax has been typed, press the Esc key to return to command mode. To save the job and exit, type :Wq; to abandon changes, type :q!\n\nThe basic syntax for scheduling a job using crontab can include the following:\n• mm-specifies the minutes past the hour when the task is to initiate (0-59).\n\n• hh—specifies the hour (0-23).\n\n• dd—can be used to specify the date within the month (0-31).\n\n• MM specifies the month in either numerical or text format (1-12 or jan, feb, mar).\n\n• weekday—sets the day of the week (1-7 or mon, tue, wed).\n\n• command-the command or script to run. This should include the full path to the file.\n\nIt is important to note that any of the time/date related parameters can be replaced by wildcards:\n\n• * specifies any or other characters.\n\n• , allows multiple values.\n\n•  - allows a range of values.\n\n•  /2 indicates every other.\n\nFor example, consider the following crontab entry:\n\n• 15 02 * * 5 /usr/bin/rsync -av --delete /home/fred /mount/rsync\n\nThis would cause the system to run the rsync backup program at 2:15am on a Friday (day 5), synchronizing the /home/fred directory with the /mount/sync folder (which could be a mount point to an external backup device).\n\nmacOS also supports cron but Apple's own launchd scheduler is preferred.\ntag:C2 L2 TD
