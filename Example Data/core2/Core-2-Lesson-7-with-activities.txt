Lesson 7\nSecuring Workstations and Data\n\nLESSON INTRODUCTION\n\nEnsuring the security of information processing systems isn't an easy job. Sources of vulnerabilities and weaknesses can seem as limitless as the range of threats and attackers poised to try to take advantage of them. As a CompTIA® A+ PC technician, you need to make yourself aware of the latest developments and best practices to use to secure systems.\n\nIn thinking about securing those systems, you also need to be aware that your focus cannot just be on the devices or even the users. The data processed by those devices and users is typically the asset that an attacker will be after. Being able to classify and identify data types and know why certain types pose high risks is essential to implementing effective security measures.\ntag: C2 L7

LESSON OBJECTIVES\nIn this lesson, you will:\n• Use security best practices to secure a workstation.\n• Implement data protection policies.\n• Describe data protection processes during incidents.\ntag: C2 L7

Topic A\nImplement Security Best Practices\n\nEXAM OBJECTIVES COVERED\n1002-2.2 Explain logical security concepts.\n1002-2.3 Compare and contrast wireless security protocols and authentication methods.\n1002-2.7 Given a scenario, implement security best practices to secure a workstation.\n \nYou have seen how logical and physical security controls can be deployed together in an access control system. In this topic, we will focus on best practices regarding authentication and authorization. You need to make sure that the devices attached to your network are only being operated by authorized users. To ensure that, you have to Use policies and technologies effectively to protect their account credentials.\ntag: C2 L7 TA

AUTHENTICATION\n\nWorkstation security is ensured by following best practices. As you have seen, best practices can include things like using anti-virus software, configuring a firewall, configuring execution control, and using patch management procedures. These controls are very important but the cornerstone of effective security is an access control system. Accounts on the computer system are configured with permissions to access resources and (for privileged accounts) rights to change the system configuration, To access an account, the user must authenticate by supplying the correct credentials, proving that he or she is the valid account holder.\n\nThe validity of the whole access control system depends on the credentials for an account being known to the account holder only. The format of the credentials is called an authentication factor. There are many different authentication factors. They can be categorized as something you know (such as a password), something you have (such a5 a smart card), or something you are (such as a fingerprint). Each has advantages and drawbacks.\ntag: C2 L7 TA

SOMETHING YOU KNOW: STRONG PASSWORDS\n\nThe typical "something you know" factor is the logon, which comprises a username and a password. The username is typically not a secret (though it's wise to share it as little as possible), but the password must be known only by a single user.\n\nFor a system to be secure against attack, strong passwords are required. Hackers often use dictionary files containing popular words and phrases, or they may investigate the background of their target to look for likely passwords. Once a hacker obtains a password, she or he can gain access to a system posing as that person.\n\nThe following rules make passwords difficult to guess:\n\n• A longer password is more secure—between 8 and 14 characters is suitable for an ordinary user account. Administrative accounts should have longer passwords.\n\n• No single words—better to use word and number/punctuation combinations.\n\n• No obvious phrases in a simple form—birthday, username, job title, and so on.\n\n+ Mix upper and lowercase.\n\n• Use an easily memorized phrase—underscored characters or hyphens can be used to represent spaces if the operating system does not support these in passwords.\n\n• Do not write down a password or share it with other users.\n\n• Change the password periodically.\n\nThe main problem with passwords is that they are prone to user error; selecting weak passwords, writing them down, and so on. Some types of behavior can be improved by system policies.\n\nAnother concern is password management. A typical user might be faced with having to remember dozens of logons for different services and resort to using the same password for each. This is unsecure, as your security becomes dependent on the security of these other (unknown) organizations. In a Windows domain, password management can be mitigated by applications that are compatible with the Kerberos authentication mechanism used by the domain. This is referred to as single sign on. Users must also be trained to practice good password management—at the least not to re-use work passwords on websites they access in a personal capacity.\n\nAnother instance of "something you know” authentication is a password reset, mechanism, where to authorize the reset you have to answer with some personal information (childhood friend, city or town of birth, and so on).\n\nBIOS/UEFI PASSWORDS\nA system user password is one that is required before any operating system can boot. The system password can be configured by the BIOS or UEFI firmware setup program. ABIOS user password is shared by all users and consequently very rarely configured. It might be used to provide extra security on a standalone computer that does not often require user logon, such as a computer used to manage embedded systems. A PC with UEFI firmware may support pre-boot authentication. This means that the system loads an authentication application to contact an authentication server on the network and allow the user to submit the credentials for a particular user account.\n\nNote: The system user password just allows the computer to proceed with the boot process. A system/supervisor password protects access to the firmware system setup program. Configuring a user password requires a supervisor password to be set, too.\ntag: C2 L7 TA

SOMETHING YOU HAVE: SMART CARDS AND TOKENS\n\nThere are various ways to authenticate a user based on something they have (a token). smart card contains a chip that stores the user's account details in a digital certificate, The logon provider uses the certificate to decide if it should trust the card and ensure secure transmission of the credentials. The card must be presented to a card reader before the user can be authenticated. The user must typically also input a PIN or biometric scan. This prevents misuse of lost or stolen cards. Itis also possible for the data to be read wirelessly (contactless cards), via Radio Frequency Identification (RFID).\n\nAnother token-based technology is the SecurID token, from RSA. A key fob generates a random number code synchronized to a code on the server. The code changes every 60 seconds or so. This is an example of a one-time password.\n\n[file:///fig-410.png]\nkey fob token generator. (Image © 123RF.com.)\n\nThe main concerns with token-based technologies are loss and theft and the chance that the device can be faked. There are also equipment and maintenance costs.\ntag: C2 L7 TA

SOMETHING YOU ARE: BIOMETRICS\n\nSomething you are means employing some sort of biometric recognition system. Many types of biometric information can be recorded, including fingerprint patterns, signature recognition, iris or retina recognition, or facial recognition.\n\nThe chosen biometric information (the template) is scanned and recorded in a database. When the user wants to access a resource, he or she is re-scanned and the scan compared to the template. If they match, access is granted.\n\nThe main problems with biometric technology are that users find it intrusive and threatening to privacy, setup and maintenance costs, and the chance that the confirmation scan could be spoofed. For example, a facial recognition scan could be fooled by using a photo of the subject. Biometrics can also be prone to false negative and false positives. A false negative occurs when the system denies entry when it should allow it. A false positive occurs when the system grants entry when it should deny it.\ntag: C2 L7 TA

MULTIFACTOR AUTHENTICATION\n\nAn authentication technology is considered "strong" if it combines the use of more than one type of factor (multifactor). Single factor authentication systems can quite easily be compromised: a password could be written down or shared, a smart card could be lost or stolen, and a biometric system could be subject to high error rates.\n\nTwo-factor authentication combines something like a smart card or biometric mechanism with "something you know,” such as a password or PIN. Three-factor authentication combines all three technologies. An example of this would be a smart card with integrated thumb- or fingerprint reader. This means that to authenticate, the user must possess the card, the user’s fingerprint must match the template stored on the card, and the user must input a PIN.\n\nNote: Multifactor authentication requires a combination of different technologies. For example, requiring a PIN along with Date of Birth may be stronger than entering a PIN alone, but itis not multifactor.\ntag: C2 L7 TA

SOFTWARE TOKENS\n\nMost networks and services require users to authenticate before providing access. The problem is that the user does not want to have to submit his or her credentials every time he or she performs an action. The user expects the system to remember that they have authenticated already. To accommodate this, the system grants a software token to the device or app that the user used to authenticate with. Whenever the user submits a request, the app submits the authorization token as proof that the user is authenticated.\n\nIf the token system is not designed securely, any third-party that is able to obtain the token from the user's device or capture it as itis transmitted over the network will be able to act as that user. This is called a replay attack.\n\nToken-based authorization is used on Single Sign On (SSO) networks. One exampl the Kerberos authentication and authorization system used for Windows domain logon. On the web, tokens can be implemented using cookies, but JavaScript Object Notation (SON) Web Tokens (JWT) are now more popular. Software tokens can use digital signing to prove the identity of the issuing server. Tokens should also be designed with mechanisms to prevent replay. This could mean issuing them as “use once" or time-limiting them.\ntag: C2 L7 TA

REMOTE AUTHENTICATION\n\nEnterprise networks and ISPs potentially need to support hundreds or thousands of users and numerous different remote and wireless access technologies and devices. The problem arises that each access device needs to be configured with authentication information, and this information needs to be synchronized between them.\n\nRADIUS\nA scalable authentication architecture can be developed using RADIUS. RADIUS stands for Remote Authentication Dial-in User Service. Under this protocol, Authentication, Authorization, and Accounting are performed by a separate server (the AAA server). Network access devices, such as routers, switches, wireless access points, or VPN servers, function as client devices of the AAA server. Rather than storing and validating user credentials directly, they pass this data between the AAA server and the user.\n\n[file:///fig-411.png]\nRADIUS. (mage © 123RF.com)\n\nTACACS+\nTerminal Access Controller Access Control System Plus (TACACS+) is a similar protocol to RADIUS but designed to be more flexible and reliable. TACACS+ was, developed by Cisco* but is also supported on many of the other third-party and open source RADIUS server implementations. Where RADIUS is often used to authenticate connections by wireless and VPN users, TACACS* is often used in authenticating, administrative access to routers and switches.\ntag: C2 L7 TA

PASSWORD AND ACCOUNT POLICIES\n\nDespite the availability of multifactor methods, many authentication systems are still based on passwords. This means that good password management is a critical element of network security. Users can be made to choose strong passwords by configuring account policies. There are also more general account policies that can be applied to improve security.\n\nACCESS CONTROL POLICIES\nMost resources in a computer or network environment are protected from unauthorized use by an Access Control List (ACL). An ACL is basically a list of subjects (users or computers) and the privileges they have on the object (or resource). ACLS can be defined for resources such as files and directories or for network connections (a firewall ACL).\n\nThe following policies enforce the use of ACLs and ensure that they are effective:\n\n• Requiring passwords (mandatory logon}—when Windows is used for home computers, local user accounts are allowed to be configured without passwords. In a business environment, the security policy will default to requiring the user to sign. in with a password.\n\n• Change default admin user—rename default accounts so attackers cannot use known account names to access the system, It an make it harder to "hack" a computer if the identity of the default administrator or root account is concealed. In Windows, this account is disabled by default and replaced with a named account created during setup.\n\n• Change default user passwords—as well as default usernames, appliances ship with a default password, such as "admin" or "password." To secure the device, you must change this when first setting it up.\n\n• Disable guest account—the guest account allows limited access to Windows but is disabled by default. Keep it disabled to prevent unauthorized access to any shared files and folders on the device or system. File permissions can be allocated to the Everyone group account and the guest account is a member of Everyone. This might be overlooked when configuring permissions as the guest account is not typically enabled.\n\n• Restricting user permissions (least privilege}—least privilege is a basic principle of security stating that someone (or something) should be allocated the minimum necessary rights, privileges, or information to perform their role. Users can be configured either as administrators or standard users. Additionally, User Account Control mitigates against exploitation of administrative privileges.\n\nLOCAL SECURITY POLICY AND GROUP POLICY\nOn a standalone workstation, password and account policies can be configured via the Local Security Policy snap-in (sec po. msc) or the Group Policy snap-in  (gpedit.msc).\n\nNote: These tools are not available on the Basic/Home/Core editions of Windows.\n\nOn a Windows domain network, Group Policy Objects (GPO) can be saved as collections of group policy settings.\ntag: C2 L7 TA

PASSWORD PROTECTION POLICIES\n\nsystem policies can help to enforce credential management principles by stipulating particular requirements for users. Password protection policies mitigate against the risk of attackers being able to compromise an account and use it to launch other attacks on the network.\n\n[file:///fig-412.png]\nConfiguring domain password policy using Group Policy. (Screenshot used with permission from Microsoft.)\n\nThe following table provides some examples used by Windows.\n\n| Policy | Description |\n| --- | --- |\n| Minimum password length | A minimum acceptable password length is specified. |\n| Password must meet complexity requirements | Enforce password complexity rules—that is, no use of username within password and combination of at least six upper/lower case alpha-numeric and non-alpha-numeric characters. Note that this only applies when passwords are created or changed. Existing passwords are not tested against the policy. |\n| Maximum password age | This configures a password expiration policy. When the time limit is reached, the user is forced to change the password. |\n| Enforce password history/Minimum password age | This specifies that a unique password must be used when the user changes the password. The system remembers up to 24 previously used passwords so the minimum password age must be set to a value of 1 or greater to make the policy effective (otherwise users can quickly cycle through a number of passwords to get back to choosing an old favorite). |\n| User cannot change | This user account setting stops the user from changing password his or her account password. |\n| Password never expires | This user account setting can override a system policy set to force a regular password change. |\n\nNote: "Password reuse" can also mean using a work password elsewhere (on a website, for instance). Obviously, this sort of behavior can only be policed by "soft" policies.\ntag: C2 L7 TA

ACCOUNT RESTRICTIONS\n\nTo make the task of compromising the user security system harder, account restrictions can also be used. These may be specific to a particular user or applied globally.\n\n| Policy | Description |\n| --- | --- |\n| Logon Time Restrictions | For each account on the system, access to the server may be restricted to particular times. Periodically, the server checks whether the user has the right to continue using the network. If the user does not have the right, then an automatic logout procedure commences. |\n| Station Restrictions | User access to the server can be restricted to a particular workstation or a group of workstations. |\n| Concurrent Logons | By default, any user can log on to the domain from multiple workstations. If required, concurrent logons may be restricted to a specific number of connections. |\n| Account Expiration Date | Setting an expiration date means that an account cannot be used beyond a certain date. This option is useful for accounts for temporary and contract staff. |\n| Disable Account | Once an account is disabled, the user is denied access to the server until the network administrator re-enables the account. |\n| Failed Attempts Lockout | The network administrator may specify a maximum number of incorrect logon attempts within a certain period. Once the maximum number of incorrect logons has been reached, the server disables the account. This prevents hackers from trying to gain system access using lists of possible passwords. |\ntag: C2 L7 TA

DESKTOP LOCK AND TIMEOUT\n\nOne problem with the logon system is that once logged on, the system trusts the workstation implicitly. If a user leaves the workstation unattended, someone else could perform actions as though they were that user (a so-called "lunchtime attack"). To prevent the possibility of this happening, users should be trained to lock the workstation whenever they leave it. The simple means of doing this is to press\n\nWindows+L (every version of Windows puts the menu option for lock screen in a different place). Another way of locking the computer is to set a screensaver-required password. The screensaver can be set to timeout and lock the desktop after a set, period of inactivity (no mouse or keyboard input). The user must then input their credentials to resume the session.\n\nNote: On a domain, a GPO can be configured to enforce the use of password-protected screensavers.\n\nGUIDELINES FOR IMPLEMENTING SECURITY BEST PRACTICES\n\nHere are some best practices to follow for implementing security on workstations and data.\n\nIMPLEMENT SECURITY BEST PRACTICES\nFollow these guidelines for implementing security best practices:\n\n• Consider using multifactor authentication,\n\n• Create secure passwords.\n\n• Consider password protecting BIOS/UEFI.\n\n• Take measures to prevent software tokens from being used in replay attacks.\n\n• Consider using RADIUS in VPN implementations and TACACS* for authenticating administrative access to routers and switches.\n\n• Enforce use of ACLs through Local Security Policy or Group Policy Objects.\n\n• Enforce the use of strong passwords through GPOs.\n\n• Implement account restrictions to make compromising user security harder.\n\n• Require users to lock unattended systems.\n\n• Implement timeouts for unattended systems.\ntag: C2 L7 TA

Topic B\nImplement Data Protection Policies\n\nEXAM OBJECTIVES COVERED\n1002-1.6 Given a scenario, use Microsoft Windows Control Panel utilities.\n1002-2.2 Explain logical security concepts.\n1002-2.6 Compare and contrast the differences of basic Microsoft Windows OS security settings.\n1002-2.7 Given a scenario, implement security best practices to secure a workstation.\n1002-4.6 Explain the processes for addressing prohibited content/activity, and privacy licensing, and policy concepts.\n\nAn access control system designates which accounts are authorized to view and modify which data files or records. In designing security, however, you always have to think about what might go wrong. What if an attacker can circumvent the access. control system somehow? When data that should be kept private is breached, itis almost impossible to recover and re-secure. As a CompTIA A+ technician, itis, imperative that you be able to recognize confidential and sensitive data types and understand the mechanisms that can be deployed to keep data secure.\ntag: C2 L7 TB

DATA POLICIES\n\nMost organizations process private, confidential, and secret information, recorded in different kinds of documents or data stores. Document management, or more generally Information Content Management (ICM), is the process of managing information over its lifecycle, from creation to destruction. At each stage of the lifecycle, security considerations are vital. All employees must be trained to identify different types of confidential, private, and regulated data and follow all policies and security best practices when handling it.\n\nMost documents go through one or more draft stages before they are published and subsequently may be revised and re-published. As a draft or revision, a document will be subject to a workflow, which describes how editorial changes are made and approved. The workflow will specify who are the authors, editors, and reviewers of the document.\n\nAs part of the creation process, the document must be classified depending on how sensitive it is. Classification restricts who may see the document contents.\n\nClassification is generally divided into several levels, following military usage:\n\n• Unclassified—there are no restrictions on viewing the document.\n\n• Classified (internal use only/official use only)—viewing is restricted to the owner organization or to third-parties under a Non-disclosure Agreement (NDA).\n\n• Confidential—the information is highly sensitive, for viewing only by approved persons within the organization (and possibly by trusted third-parties under NDA).\n\n• Secret—the information is too valuable to permit any risk of its capture. Viewing is severely restricted.\n\n• Top Secret—this is the highest level of classification.\n\nConfidential, secret, and top-secret information should be securely protected (encrypted) for storage and transmission.\n\nOver its lifecycle, information may change in sensitivity, typically (but not always) becoming less sensitive over time. A document may be downgraded to a lower security level or eventually declassified. In this circumstance, there needs to be a clear process of authorization and notification so that confidentiality is not breached.\n\nCorporate documents such as accounts information, product designs, and sales plans are relatively simple to identify and classify. Companies must also take regard of other types of sensitive information, such as Personally Identifiable Information (Pll), software licenses, and Digital Rights Management (DRM) content.\n\nNote: While we have discussed documents, the same principles hold for other types of information store, such as records in a database.\ntag: C2 L7 TB

PII\n\nThe rise in consciousness of identity theft as a serious crime and growing threat means that there is an increasing impetus on government, educational, and commercial organizations to take steps to obtain, store, and process Personally Identifiable Information (PII) more sensitively and securely.\n\nPII is data that can be used to identify, contact, or locate an individual or, in the case of identity theft, to impersonate them. A social security number is a good example of PII. Others include names, date of birth, email address, telephone number, street address, biometric data, and so on.\n\nSome types of information may be Pll depending on the context. For example, when someone browses the web using a static IP address, the IP address is PII. An address that is dynamically assigned by the ISP may not be considered PII. These are the sort of complexities that must be considered when laws are introduced to control the collection and storage of personal data.\n\nEmployees should be trained to identify PII and to handle personal or sensitive data appropriately. This means not making unauthorized copies or allowing the data to be seen or captured by any unauthorized persons. Examples of treating sensitive data carelessly include leaving order forms with customers’ credit card details on view on a desk, putting a credit card number in an unencrypted notes field in a customer database, or forwarding an email with personal details somewhere in the thread.\n\nNote: in the European Union (EU), personal data is subject to Data Protection laws, recently updated by the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) framework, which make data handlers responsible for compliant collection and storage of personal information. The US does not have comparable legislation though it does operate a “Privacy Shield” scheme for US companies exchanging data with EU ones. While there is 1no single "data protection” law in the US, there are various Federal and state-level statutes that impact privacy and data collection/processing.\n\nPII may also be defined as responses to challenge questions, such as "What is your favorite color/pet/movie?" PII is often used for password reset mechanisms and to confirm identity over the telephone. Consequently, disclosing PII inadvertently can lead to identity theft.\n\nPROTECTED HEALTH INFORMATION (PHI)\nProtected Health Information (PHI) refers to medical and insurance records, plus associated hospital and laboratory test results. PHI may be associated with a specific person or used as an anonymized or de-identified data set for analysis and research. An anonymized data set is one where the identifying data is removed completely. A de- identified data set contains codes that allow the subject information to be reconstructed by the data provider. PHI trades at high values on the black market, making it an attractive target. Criminals would seek to exploit the data for insurance fraud or possibly to blackmail victims. PHI data is highly sensitive and unrecoverable. Unlike a credit card number or bank account number, it cannot be changed. Consequently, the reputational damage that would be caused by a PHI data breach is huge.\n\nPAYMENT CARD INDUSTRY DATA SECURITY STANDARD (PCI DSS)\nThere are also industry-enforced regulations mandating data security. A good example is the Payment Card industry Data Security Standard (PCI DSS) governing processing of credit card and other bank card payments. It sets out protections that must be provided if cardholder data—names, addresses, account numbers, and card numbers and expiry dates—is stored. It also sets out sensitive authentication data, such as the CV2 confirmation number or the PIN used for the card (not that the cardholder should ever divulge that to a third party).\n\nRegulations such as PCI DSS have specific cybersecurity control requirements; others simply mandate "best practice," as represented by a particular industry or international framework. Frameworks for security controls are established by organizations such as the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST).\ntag: C2 L7 TB

ACLs AND DIRECTORY PERMISSIONS\n\nIt's easy to overlook the fact that the most important part of a computer system is the data stored on it. A computer is just a tool and is relatively easy to replace. Data could represent days, months, or years of work. Data can be protected against unauthorized access, modification, or deletion by several mechanisms.\n\nA permission is a security setting that determines the level of access a user or group account has to a particular resource. Permissions can be associated with a variety of resources, such as files, printers, shared folders, and network directory databases. Permissions can typically be configured to allow different levels of privileges, or to deny privileges to users who should not access a resource.\n\nA permission is usually implemented as an Access Control List (ACL) attached to each resource, The ACL contains a number of Access Control Entries (ACE), which are records of subjects and the permissions they hold on the resource. A subject could be identified in a number of ways. On a network firewall, subjects might be identified by MAC address, IP address, and/or port number. In the case of directory permissions in Windows, each user and security group account has a unique Security ID (SID).\n\nRecall that in Windows, there are two systems of permissions:\n\n•  File-system permissions enforced by NTFS allow the object owner to set access. control to individual files and folders. File-level permissions will prevent any unauthorized access to a file or folder both across the network and locally by prompting all users, including the user who created the file, to enter the correct. user name and password for access.\n\n• Share-level permissions only apply when a folder is accessed over a network connection. They offer no protection against a user who's logged on locally to the computer or server containing the shared resource.\n\nSeparate permissions at the share level and file level is unique to Windows environments. In Linux, the same set of read, write, and delete permissions are valid at both the local level and across the network.\ntag: C2 L7 TB

DATA ENCRYPTION\n\nWhen data is hosted on a file system, it can be protected by the operating system's security model. Each file or folder can be configured with an Access Control List (ACL), describing the permissions that different users (or user groups) have on the file. These permissions are enforced only when the OS mediates access to the device. If the disk is, exposed to a different OS, the permissions could be overridden. To protect data at-rest against these risks, the information stored on a disk can be encrypted.\n\nFILE/FOLDER ENCRYPTION (EFS)\nOne approach to encrypting file system data is to apply encryption to individual files or folders. The Encrypting File System (EFS) feature of NTFS supports file and folder encryption. EFS is only available to use with professional/enterprise editions of Windows.\n\nWithout strong authentication, encrypted data is only as secure as the user account. If the password can be compromised, then so can the data. The user's password grants access to the key that performs the file encryption and decryption.\n\nThere is also the chance of data loss if the key is lost or damaged. This can happen if the user's profile is damaged, if the user's password is reset by an administrator, or if Windows is reinstalled. It is possible to back up the key or (on a Windows domain) to set up recovery agents with the ability to decrypt data.\n\nTo apply encryption, open the file's or folder's property sheet and select the Advanced button. Check the Encrypt contents box, then confirm the dialog boxes.\n\n[file:///fig-421.png]\nApplying encryption to a folder using EFS. (Screenshot used with permission from Microsoft.)\n\nFolders and files that have been encrypted can be shown with green color coding in Explorer. Any user other than the one that encrypted the file will receive an "Access Denied" error when trying to browse, copy, or print the file.\n\n[file:///fig-422a.png]\nA file that has been encrypted cannot be opened by other users—even administrators. (Screenshot used with permission from Microsoft.)\ntag: C2 L7 TB

FULL DISK ENCRYPTION\n\nAn alternative to file encryption is to use a Full Disk Encryption (FDE) product. The BitLocker disk encryption product is built into Windows Enterprise editions and is available with Windows 7 Ultimate, Windows 8 Pro, and Windows 10 Professional.\n\n[file:///fig-422b.png]\nConfiguring BitLocker and BitLocker To Go via the Control Panel. (Screenshot used with permission from Microsoft.)\n\nDisk encryption carries a processing overhead but modern computers usually have\nprocessing capacity to spare. Its particularly useful for mobile devices, such as laptops, and removable drives. The main advantage is that it does not depend on the user to remember to encrypt data so mitigates the risk of data loss in the case of the theft or loss of the device. Disk encryption also encrypts the swap file, print queues, temporary files, and so on.\n\nBitLocker® can be used with any volumes on fixed (internal) drives. It can also be used with removable drives in its BitLocker To Go form.\n\n[file:///fig-423.png]\nRemovable drive protected with BitLocker To Go. (Screenshot used with permission from Microsoft.)\n\nNote: in older Windows versions (Vista and XP), there was no support for encrypting removable drives. BitLocker To Go Reader is a standalone application that allows USB drives encrypted in Windows 7 or later to be read in Windows XP or Windows Vista. This gives the user read-only access to the files on the drive. They can be copied but this removes the encryption from the copies.\n\nWhen the data is encrypted, the user must have access to the encryption key to access it, Some disk encryption products, including BitLocker, can make use of a Trusted Platform Module (TPM) chip in the computer to tie use of a hard disk to a particular motherboard. The TPM is used as a secure means of storing the encryption key and to ensure the integrity of the OS used to boot the machine, Alternatively, the key could be stored on a removable smart card or on a USB stick. The computer's firmware must support booting from USB for the last option to work.\n\nNote: The TPM must be configured with an owner password (often the system password set in firmware). You can manage TPM settings from Windows using the TPM Management snap-in (select TPM Administration from the BitLocker applet).\n\nDuring BitLocker setup, a recovery key is also generated. This should be stored on removable media (or written down) and stored securely (and separately from the computer). This key can be used to recover the encrypted drive if the startup key is lost.\ntag: C2 L7 TB

DATA LOSS PREVENTION (DLP)\n\nIn a workplace where mobile devices with huge storage capacity proliferate and high bandwidth network links are readily available, attempting to prevent the loss of data by controlling the types of storage device allowed to connect to PCs and networks can be impractical. Another option is to use policies or software to prevent data "leakage" or loss by focusing on the data files.\n\nUsers must of course be trained about document confidentiality and make sure that they are aware of the insecurity of unencrypted communications. This should also be backed up by Human Resources (HR) and auditing policies that ensure staff are trustworthy, "Soft" measures such as these do not protect against user error or insider threats, however.\n\nData Loss Prevention (DLP) products scan content in structured formats, such as a database with a formal access control model, or unstructured formats, such as email or word processing documents. DLP software uses some sort of dictionary database or algorithm (regular expression matching) to identify confidential data. The transfer of content to removable media, such as USB devices, or by email, IM, or even social media, can then be blocked if it does not conform to a predefined policy.\n\nSuch solutions will usually consist of the following components:\n\n• Policy server—to configure confidentiality rules and policies, log incidents, and compile reports.\n\n• Endpoint agents—to enforce policy on client computers, even when they are not connected to the network.\n\n• Network agents—to scan communications at network borders and interface with web and messaging servers to enforce policy.\n\n[file:///fig-424.png]\nCreating a Data Loss Prevention policy in Office 365. Used with permission from Microsoft.\ntag: C2 L7 TB

SOFTWARE LICENSING AND DRM\n\nAs well as managing use of confidential and sensitive data, you need to consider methods for identifying and removing prohibited content. The acceptable use policies built into most employee contracts will prohibit the abuse of Internet services to download games or obscene content. Employees should also avoid using work accounts for personal communications.\n\nProhibited content also extends to the installation and use of software. When you buy software, you must accept the license governing its use, often called the End User License Agreement (EULA). The terms of the license will vary according to the type of software, but the basic restriction is usually that the software may only be installed on one computer.\n\nThe software is often activated using a product key, which will be a long string of characters and numbers printed on the box or disk case. The product key will generate a different product ID, which is often used to obtain technical support. The product ID is displayed when the application starts and can be accessed using the About option on the Help menu.\n\nA company may have hundreds of employees who need the same software on their computers. Software manufacturers do not expect such companies to buy individual copies of the software for each employee. Instead, they will issue a license for multiple users, which means that the company can install the software on an agreed number of computers for their employees to use.\n\nIf a site has a large number of computers, these computers are often networked. This means that software bought under license can be installed onto a network server so that all authorized users can access it without it being installed on each individual computer.\n\nConsider the example of Microsoft Windows. Windows is commercial software, meaning it must be paid for. A condition of installing Windows is accepting the EULA. Microsoft requires you to activate Windows when you install it, which helps them to verify that you are not breaking the terms of the license. There are several different types of license, summarized here:\n\n• Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM)—this is for pre-installed versions of Windows sold with new PCs. The license is not transferable and the software may not be installed on a different PC.\n\n• Retall—these personal licenses are subdivided into Full and Upgrade versions of software. The software may be transferred between computers but may only be installed on one computer at any one time. Upgrade versions require a valid license and setup media for a qualifying upgrade product.\n\n• Volume—these enterprise licenses are schemes to simplify license administration in larger organizations and businesses.\n\n• Server—licensing for servers is different from licensing desktop software. As well as, a license for the software installed on the server, Client Access Licenses (CAL) are required, based on the number of clients accessing the software services. CALS can be sold per server (limiting the number of simultaneous accesses) or per seat (specifying each unique device or user).\n\nIt is illegal to use or distribute unauthorized copies of software (pirate copies). Pirated software often contains errors and viruses as well. Enterprises need monitoring systems to ensure that their computers are not hosting unlicensed or pirated software.

SHAREWARE, FREEWARE, AND OPEN SOURCE APPLICATIONS\n\nShareware, freeware, and open source licenses are different ways of distributing applications to commercial software:\n\n• Shareware is software that you can install free of charge so that you can evaluate it for a limited period. If you decide to continue using the software after this period, you must register it, usually for a fee. When you register the software you often become entitled to extra features and support.\n\n• Freeware is software that is available free of charge.\n\nNote: Even if software is distributed as shareware or freeware, the copyright i still held by the publisher or designer. Both shareware and freeware may stil be governed by allcense, which may restrict its use (for example, to prevent commercial use of the product or to redistribute or resell it).\n\n• Open source is software that also makes the program code used to design it available. The idea is that other programmers can investigate the program and make it more stable and useful. An open source license does not forbid commercial use of applications derived from the original, but it is likely to impose the same\nconditions on further redistributions.\n\nDIGITAL RIGHTS MANAGEMENT (DRM)\nDigital music and video is often subject to copy protection and Digital Rights Management (DRM). When you purchase music or video online, the vendor may license the file for use on a restricted number of devices. You generally need to use your account with the vendor to authorize and deauthorize devices when they change. Most DRM systems have been defeated by determined attackers and consequently there is plenty of content with DRM security removed circulating, From an enterprise's, point-of-view, this is prohibited content and they need monitoring systems to ensure that their computers are not hosting pirated content files.\ntag: C2 L7 TB

Topic C\nProtect Data During Incident Response\n\nEXAM OBJECTIVES COVERED\n1002-4.6 Explain the processes for addressing prohibited content/activity, and privacy, licensing, and policy concepts.\n\nWhile you hope that security and data handling policies will be sufficient to protect your computer systems and networks, you also need to consider the situations where those protections fail. To cope with failures of security policy, or attempted breaches of policy, organizations need well-rehearsed incident response procedures to investigate and remediate the breach.\n\nAs an IT technician, you will often be involved in identifying and reporting security incidents and potentially in assisting with investigations and evidence gathering. It is important that you understand some of the general principles of effective incident response and forensic investigation procedures.\ntag: C2 L7 TC

INCIDENT RESPONSE POLICIES\n\nIn the course of performing technical support, you may have to report or respond to security incidents. A security incident could be one of a wide range of different scenarios, such as:\n\n• A computer or network infected with viruses, worms, or Trojans.\n\n• An attempt to break into a computer system or network through phishing or an "evil twin" Wi-Fi access point.\n\n• An attempt to damage a network through a Denial of Service (DoS) attack.\n\n• Users with unlicensed software.\n\n• Finding prohibited material on a PC—illegal copies of copyrighted material, obscene content, or confidential documents that the user should not have access to.\n\nAn incident response policy sets out procedures and guidelines for dealing with security incidents. The actions of staff immediately following detection of an incident can have a critical impact on these aims, so an effective policy and well-trained employees are crucial. Incident response is also likely to require coordinated action and authorization from several different departments or managers, which adds a further level of complexity.\n\nSECURITY INCIDENT HANDLING LIFECYCLE\nThe NIST Computer Security incident Handling Guide special publication SP800-61 identifies the following stages in an incident response lifecycle:\n\n• Preparation—making the system resilient to attack in the first place. This includes hardening systems, writing procedures, and establishing confidential lines of communication. It also implies creating incident response resources and procedures.\n\n• Detection and Analysis—determining whether an incident has taken place and assessing how severe it might be, followed by notification of the incident to stakeholders.\n\n• Containment, Eradication, and Recovery—limiting the scope and magnitude of the incident. The typical response is to "pull the plug" on the affected system, but this is not always appropriate. Once the incident is contained, the cause can then be removed and the system brought back to a secure state.\n\n• Post-incident Activity—analyzing the incident and responses to identify whether procedures or systems could be improved. It is also imperative to document the incident.\ntag: C2 L7 TC

INCIDENT RESPONSE DOCUMENTATION\n\nA serious incident will be a highly pressured scenario. Without adequate preparation, staff will not be able to respond effectively. Without clear policies and guidelines, staff discovering and investigating the incident are more likely to make bad decisions. Without an incident log, different employees will find it harder to coordinate their efforts. If there are no contact lists and lines of communication, information about the incident might be disclosed inappropriately, whether that means senior personnel not. being informed or knowledge of the incident becoming public too early.\n\nPreparing for incident response means establishing documented policies and procedures for dealing with security breaches and the personnel and resources to implement those policies. Incident response documentation should also establish clear lines of communication, both for reporting incidents and for notifying affected parties as the management of an incident progresses. It is vital to have essential contact information readily available. Also consider that the incident response personnel might require secure, out-of-band communication methods, in case standard network communication channels have been compromised.\n\nAs with any type of procedural documentation, this must also be kept up to date with changes. The procedures should be reviewed periodically (every few months) but events such as staff changes, the deployment of new network or security systems, or changes in the legal/regulatory environment should trigger an immediate review of incident response documents.\ntag: C2 L7 TC

FIRST RESPONDERS\n\nAn incident is any event that breaches security policy. Of course, this covers a huge number and variety of different scenarios. In order to prioritize and manage incidents, an organization should develop some method of categorizing and prioritizing them. (triage), in the same way that troubleshooting support incidents can be logged and managed.\n\nLarger organizations will provide a dedicated Computer Security Incident Response Team (CSIRT) as a single point-of-contact for security incidents so that they can be reported through the proper channels.\n\nThe members of this team should be able to provide the range of decision making and technical skills required to deal with different types of incidents. The team needs a mixture of senior decision makers (up to director level) who can authorize actions following the most serious incidents, managers, and technicians (who can deal with minor incidents on their own initiative).\n\nWhen an incident is detected, itis critical that the appropriate person on the CSIRT be notified so that they can take charge of the situation and formulate the appropriate response (first responder). This means that employees at all levels of the organization must be trained to recognize and respond appropriately to actual or suspected security incidents.\n\nIt is also wise to provide for confidential reporting so that employees are not afraid to report insider threats, such as fraud or misconduct. It may also be necessary to use an "out-of-band" method of communication so as not to alert the intruder that his or her attack has been detected.\n \nNote: An employee (or ex-employee) who reports misconduct is refered to as a whistleblower.\n\nWhen notification has taken place, the CSIRT or other responsible person(s) can formulate the response.\ntag: C2 L7 TC

DATA AND DEVICE PRESERVATION\n\nComputer forensics is the science of collecting evidence from computer systems to a standard that will be accepted in a court of law. Itis highly unlikely that a computer forensic professional will be retained by an organization, so such investigations are normally handled by law enforcement agencies. Like DNA or fingerprints, digital evidence is mostly latent. Latent means that the evidence cannot be seen with the naked eye; rather, it must be interpreted using a machine or process.\n\nIf a forensic investigation is launched (or if one is a possibility), itis important that technicians and managers are aware of the processes that the investigation will use. It is vital that they are able to assist the investigator and that they not do anything to compromise the investigation. In a trial, the defense will try to exploit any uncertainty or mistake regarding the integrity of evidence or the process of collecting it.\n\nCOLLECTION OF EVIDENCE\nThe first phase of a forensic investigation is collection of evidence. The two principal questions here are:\n\n• What evidence must be collected?\n\n• How should the evidence be collected?\n\nNeither question is trivial. A computer system may contain multiple gigabytes (or even terabytes) of data, most of which will not be relevant to the incident. Evidence may only exist in volatile storage (system or cache RAM). If the computer system is not owned by the organization, there is the question of whether search or seizure is legally valid. This may also make it difficult for law enforcement agents to begin an investigation, For example, if an employee is accused of fraud, you must verify that the employee's equipment and data can be legally seized and searched. Any mistake may make evidence gained from the search inadmissible.\n\nThe question of "how" is complicated because it is much more difficult to capture evidence from a digital "crime scene” than itis from a physical one. As mentioned, some evidence will be lost if the computer system is powered off; on the other hand, some evidence may be unobtainable until the system is powered off. Additionally, evidence may be lost depending on whether the system is shut down or “frozen” by suddenly disconnecting the power.\n\nThe general procedure will be as follows:\n\n1. The crime scene must be thoroughly documented using photographs and ideally video and audio. Investigators must record every action they take in identifying, collecting, and handling evidence.\n\nNote: Remember that ifthe matter comes to trial, the trial could take place months or years after the event. Itis vital to record impressions and actions in notes.\n\n2. The investigator should then interview witnesses to establish what they were doing at the scene and also to gather information about the computer system.\n\n3. If possible, evidence is gathered from the live system, including screenshots of display screens and the contents of cache and system memory, using forensic software tools. Itis vital that these tools do nothing to modify the digital data that they capture.\n\n4. Forensic tools are used to make a copy of data on the hard drive(s). This is performed using drive imaging rather than file copy methods, so that the copy is. made at sector level.\n\n5. A cryptographic hash is made of the collected data. This can be used to prove that the digital evidence collected has not been modified subsequently to its collection.\n\n6. The system is either shut down or powered off.\n\n7. Depending on the strength of evidence required, the physical drives are then identified, bagged, sealed, and labeled using tamper-proof bags. It is also appropriate to ensure that the bags have anti-static shielding to reduce the possibility that data will be damaged or corrupted on the electronic media by Electrostatic Discharge (ESD). Any other physical evidence deemed necessary is also "Bagged and Tagged."\ntag: C2 L7 TC

CHAIN OF CUSTODY\n\nIt is vital that the evidence collected at the crime scene conform to a valid timeline. Digital information is susceptible to tampering, so access to the evidence must be tightly controlled.\n\nA crucial element of the investigation is that each step is documented and (ideally) recorded. This proves that the evidence has been handled correctly and has not been tampered with. Once evidence has been bagged, it must not subsequently be handled or inspected, except in controlled circumstances.\n\nChain of Custody form records where, when, and who collected the evidence, who has handled it subsequently, and where it was stored. The chain of custody must show access to, plus storage and transportation of, the evidence at every point from the crime scene to the court room. Anyone handling the evidence must sign the chain of custody and indicate what they were doing with it.\ntag: C2 L7 TC

Activity 7-4\nDiscussing Data Protection During Incident Response\n\nSCENARIO\nAnswer the following questions to check your understanding of the topic.\n\n1. What is incident reporting?\n\n2. Why are the actions of a first responder critical in the context of a forensic investigation?\n\n3. What does Chain of Custody documentation prove?\n\n4. The contract ended recently for several workers who were hired for a specific project. The IT department has not yet removed all of those employees' login accounts. It appears that one of the accounts has been used to access the network, and a rootkit was installed on a server. You immediately contact the agency the employee was hired through and learn that the employee is out of the country, So it is unlikely that this person caused the problem.  What actions do you need to take?\ntag: C2 L7 TC A7-4

Summary\n\nIn this lesson, you implemented and described many concepts and techniques that can be used to establish the desired level of security for data and workstations within an organization. Every organization will have different security requirements based on the type of business they conduct. Itis your job to understand those requirements and know how security controls should be implemented to directly support those needs.\n\nWhich security best practices do you feel are the most important? Which are the minimum measures that should be taken? Does your organization implement good security practices?\n\nHave you had experience with security incidents such as data breaches? What might have been done differently to further protect the data that was put at risk?\ntag: C2 L7 SUMMARY
