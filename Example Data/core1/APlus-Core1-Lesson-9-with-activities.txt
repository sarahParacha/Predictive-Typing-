Topic A\nMobile Device Types\n\nEXAM OBJECTIVES COVERED\n1001-1.4 Compare and contrast characteristics of various types of other mobile devices.\n\nDriven by the iPhone® and iPad®, the last few years have seen a huge uptake in the use of mobile devices. In some instances they have replaced traditional computer form factors (laptop and desktop) for day-to-day tasks, such as messaging/email and activities for this topic, browsing the web. In this topic, you will learn about the smartphone and tablet form factors and about other types of portable computing technologies.\nTag: C1 L9 TA

MOBILE DEVICES\n\nAs an A+ technician, your primary focus is likely to be on the more traditional system hardware components and laptop technologies. However, you might also be asked to support devices in the mobile computing realm. Not only has mobile technology reached a new level of performance and portability, but also the use of these devices is on the rise every day. As a certified A+ technician, you will be expected to understand how these devices work and how they should be deployed within the workplace.\n\nMobile devices such as smartphones and tablets are based on one of three operating systems (Apple® iOS®, Android™, or Windows Mobile iOS®, Android™, or Windows Mobile®) and a store-based software  ecosystem, which allows for third-party apps to be downloaded to add functionality to the device. The main distinction between a smartphone and tablet is the size of the device, rather than its functionality.\n\nThe major smartphone and tablet vendors are Apple and Samsung. Other vendors include LG, Google™, HTC, Huawei, Motorola/Lenovo, Microsoft®, Nokia, Sony, and Amazon™.\nTag: C1 L9 TA

SMARTPHONES\n\nA smartphone is a device with roughly the same functionality as a personal computer that can be operated with a single hand. Previous handheld computers, known as Personal Digital Assistants (PDA), and earlier types of mobile phones with some software functionality (feature phones), were hampered by clumsy user interfaces.\n\nModern smartphones use touchscreen displays, making them much easier to operate. Most smartphones have a screen size between 4.5" and 5.7". Leading smartphones provide high resolution screens. For example, the iPhone X has a resolution of 2436x1125.\n\nSmartphones have fast multi core CPUs, anywhere between 2 and 6 GB system memory, and 16 GB+ flash memory storage. They come with features such as premium front and back digital cameras, input sensors like accelerometers, and Global Positioning System (GPS) chips. They can establish network links using Wi-Fi and a cellular data plan.\n\n(https://4sorcero.s3.amazonaws.com/byteback/core_1/fig_core_1_455a.png)\nTypical smartphone form factor.

TABLETS\n\nPrior to the iPad, tablet PCs were usually laptops with touchscreens. The iPad defined a new form factor; smaller than a laptop and with no physical keyboard. Tablets tend to be sized at around either 10" or 7" screens. Tablets use a range of screen resolutions, depending on the price. Microsoft's Surface® 4 tablet features a resolution of 2736x1824.\n\n(https://4sorcero.s3.amazonaws.com/byteback/core_1/fig_core_1_455b.png)\nAn example of a tablet. (Image © 123RF.com.)\n\nMany Windows® mobile devices adopt a hybrid approach where a laptop can be converted into a tablet by flipping the screen. Microsoft's Surface Pro tablet is available with a detachable keyboard, which can also function as a cover for the screen. Other vendors are also producing hybrid devices that can function as both a laptop and a tablet.\n\nNetwork links are mainly established using Wi-Fi, although some tablets come with a cellular data option, too.\n\nPHABLET\nPhablets sit between smartphones and tablets in terms of size and usability. The name is a portmanteau of Phone and Tablet. They were first popularized by Samsung with their successful Note devices. Phablets have screen sizes between 5.5" and 7". These devices often come with a stylus which can be used for note taking, sketching, and annotations.\n\nPhablets always come with cellular data and a connection to the phone system, as well as Wi-Fi.\nTag: C1 L9 TA

MOBILE DEVICES VS. LAPTOPS\n\nLaptops and smartphones/tablets/hybrids are obviously all classes of portable or\nmobile devices, but you should be aware of the factors that distinguish them.\n\n(https://4sorcero.s3.amazonaws.com/byteback/core_1/table_core_1_456.png)\n\nProcessors: CPUs and their chipsets for smartphones and tablets are often based on the ARM (Advanced RISC Machine) microarchitecture, such as the Apple A, Samsung Exynos, and NVIDIA Tegra derivatives. RISC stands for Reduced Instruction Set Computing. RISC microarchitectures use simple instructions processed very quickly. This contrasts with Complex (CISC) microarchitectures, which use more powerful instructions but process each one more slowly. Intel's PC/laptop CPU microarchitecture is CISC with RISC enhancements (micro-ops).\n\nAs well as the computing power to keep up with increasingly complex apps and games available for these devices (many models are now dual- or quad-core and some use 64-bit CPUs), mobile CPUs must deliver power and thermal efficiency to maximize battery life to an even greater extent than laptops.\n\nSystem memory: Tablet RAM (a low power DDR SDRAM variant) works much as it does in a PC or laptop to store instructions for the OS when it loads plus any apps the user starts.\n\nStorage: Solid State Drives (flash memory) are used for mass storage rather than hard disks (though this is increasingly the case for laptops and PCs, too).\n\nComponent replacements/upgrades: Many of the hardware components of a laptop can be fixed and replaced when issues arise. There are few field-serviceable parts in a smartphone or tablet. What makes it difficult to repair a tablet is that the parts are soldered and not socketed. Many components are glued into place to keep them stable. When something breaks, in most cases, the entire device needs to be replaced. Similarly, components in a tablet are not upgradeable.\n\nOperating System: Laptops can run a number of different operating systems, that if an iOS device is including versions from Microsoft®, Linux®, and UNIX®. Smartphones and tablets can only run the OS that the device was manufactured to run (iOS, Android, or Windows).\nTag: C1 L9 TA

MOBILE DISPLAY/TOUCH INTERFACE\n\nA touchscreen allows the user to control the OS directly by swiping or tapping with a finger (or with a stylus) rather than using navigation buttons or a scroll wheel.\n\nModern mobile devices use capacitive touchscreens. These capacitive displays support multitouch, meaning that gestures such as "sweeping" or "pinching" the screen can be interpreted as events and responded to by software in a particular way. Newer devices are also starting to provide haptic feedback, or touch responsiveness, making virtual key presses or gestures feel more "real" to the user. On the latest models, screens feature light sensors to dim and brighten displays based on ambient conditions. Some devices also feature an eye tracking display to scroll up and down based on where the user is looking.\n\nThe touchscreen itself is covered by a thin layer of scratch-resistant, shock-resistant tempered glass, such as Corning's Gorilla Glass. Some users may also apply an additional screen protector. If so, these need to be applied carefully (without bubbling) supports compass-so as not to interfere with the touch capabilities of the screen.\n\nApple uses its own version of shatter resistant glass on its current models which is coupled with its branded Retina Display. Other manufacturers utilize Samsung-derived displays, whereas Samsung's flagship phone utilizes a OLED display.\n\nMost mobile devices can be used either in portrait or landscape orientation. A component called an accelerometer can detect when the device is moved and change the screen orientation appropriately. There will actually be three accelerometers to measure movement along three axes. Newer devices may use both accelerometers and gyroscopes to deliver more accurate readings. As well as switching screen orientation, this can be used as a control mechanism (for example, a driving game could allow the tablet itself to function as a steering wheel).\n\nOn some devices, these sensors can be calibrated via a utility that uses a predetermined pattern of movement to calibrate the sensor.\nTag: C1 L9 TA

MOBILE DEVICE FORM FACTORS\n\nMobile devices are even less likely than laptops to have field serviceable parts. The electronics will be densely packed and often soldered or glued together. Most will require return to the manufacturer to replace failed components such as a battery, display screen, or storage device.\n\n(https://4sorcero.s3.amazonaws.com/byteback/core_1/fig_core_1_457.png)\nMobile handset with cover removed—note the slot for the SIM card in the top-right and that the battery is accessible but not designated as user-removable. (Image by guruxox © 123RF.com.)\n\nSome mobiles have a user-replaceable battery, accessed by removing the cover. There will also be a port for a Subscriber Identity Module (SIM) card for GSM-based or 4G LTE cellular access. This may also be fitted by removing the case. Refer to the device documentation for instructions on removing the case. Always power off the device before opening the case.\n\nCaution: While it would usually void the warranty to further disassemble the device, there may be some circumstances in which you want to replace a part yourself. The best guide to doing so is a website hosting gadget "teardown" videos and repair guides, such ifixit.com\nTag: C1 L9 TA

E-READERS\n\nUnlike a tablet, an e-reader is designed for the sole purpose of reading digital books and magazines (with perhaps the option to add annotations). E-readers use electrophoretic ink (e-ink) technology to create an  Electronic Paper Display (EPD). Compared to the LED or OLED display used on a tablet, an EPD has low power consumption but facilitates high contrast reading in a variety of ambient light conditions. In typical conditions, these screens do not need to use a backlight, saving power and extending battery life. It is not unusual to get several days of usage on a single charge for these devices. Like most tablets and smartphones, an e-reader is charged using a USB cable.\n\n(https://4sorcero.s3.amazonaws.com/byteback/core_1/fig_core_1_458.png)\nAn example of an e-reader device. (Image © 123RF.com.)\n\nE-readers are manufactured for major book retailers such as Amazon and Barnes and Noble. They have Wi-Fi connectivity to download e-books directly from the retailer's webstore.\nTag: C1 L9 TA

WEARABLE TECHNOLOGY\n\nElectronics manufacturing allows a great deal of computing power to be packed within a small space. Consequently, computing functionality is being added to wearable items, such as watches, bracelets, and eyeglasses.\n\nSMART WATCHES\nSmart watches have risen in popularity in recent years. Current competing technologies are based on the Android Wear OS, Samsung's Tizen OS, and Apple iOS, each with their own separate app ecosystems. A smart watch is likely to be customizable with different watch faces and wrist straps.\n\n(https://4sorcero.s3.amazonaws.com/byteback/core_1/fig_core_1_459a.png)\nAn example of a smart watch. (Image © 123RF.com.)\n\nMost smart watches use Bluetooth  to pair with a smartphone. They are able to display key information at a glance (emails, messages, and social media status, for instance), allowing the user to better interact with the phone. Some newer smart watches are starting to appear with their own Wi-Fi connectivity, allowing use of the watch without proximity to a paired phone.\n\nAs well as helping with personal information management, many smart watches come with health features. Technologies bundled include heart rate monitors via Infrared (IR) sensors, accelerometers to measure sleeping patterns and movement for exercise, plus cameras and IR sensors to operate devices such as TVs.\n\nFITNESS MONITORS\nAs the name suggests, fitness monitors focus on exercise and health uses rather than a range of computing tasks. This makes them cheaper devices than smart watches. They usually connect via Wi-Fi or Bluetooth to send data to a mobile app or PC software for analysis. Some feature a GPS tracker to allow runners to map their exercise accurately.\n\n(https://4sorcero.s3.amazonaws.com/byteback/core_1/fig_core_1_459b.png)\nExample of a wearable fitness monitor. (Image © 123RF.com.)\n\nFeatures of fitness monitors might include:\n• Pedometer to count the steps taken during a specified period of time.\n• Accelerometer to measure the intensity of the workout.\n• Heart rate and blood pressure monitors.\n• A calculation of the number of calories burned.\n\nVR/AR HEADSETS AND SMART GLASSES\nA Virtual Reality (VR) headset is designed to replace what you can see and hear in the real world with sights and sounds from a game or conferencing app generated by software. There are tethered VR headsets that connect to a computer as a peripheral device, but it is also possible to use a smartphone with a headset to get the VR experience.\n\nMobile VR headsets, such as Samsung Gear or Google Daydream View™, only work with selected (premium) smartphone models. These headsets contain lenses that split the smartphone display into a stereoscopic image, giving the illusion of depth. The headsets also come with a motion controller to allow you to interact with objects in the VR environment.\n\nNote: There are also standalone mobile VR headsets, such as the Oculus Go. This contains a basic smartphone (without cellular capability) embedded in the headset. Apple does not make a VR headset for the iPhone (at the time of writing), but there are third-party options.\n\nAugmented Reality (AR) is a somewhat similar technology to VR. Rather than provide a completely simulated environment, AR projects digital artefacts onto "ordinary" reality. This could be as simple as providing context-sensitive notes, messages, or advertising or as complex as generating digital avatars within the real world. This latter technique is exploited by popular smartphone camera games, such as Pokémon Go, which enables you to locate collectible cartoon characters in unlikely real world locations through your smartphone camera. Another use case is an app like Samsung's AR Emoji, which transforms people captured in the viewfinder in various unsettling ways.\n\nThere are also some AR devices, though they have not gained a very large market yet. Smart glasses were pioneered by Google with their Google Glass range and Google is rumored to be working on a more sophisticated AR headset (codenamed Google A65 at time of writing). Other AR-like devices are made by Microsoft (HoloLens ) and AiR for industrial applications.\n\n(https://4sorcero.s3.amazonaws.com/byteback/core_1/fig_core_1_460.png)\nExample of smart glasses. (Image © 123RF.com.)\n\nNetwork connectivity and pairing with other mobile devices is provided by Wi-Fi and/or Bluetooth. Most AR headsets or smart glasses also come with a camera, and there are issues arising due to the potential invasion of privacy or breach of confidentiality such a relatively concealed recording device could pose.\n\nInput methods allowing the user to control the software running on the glasses include buttons, eye tracking, natural language voice input, plus gesture controls.\nTag: C1 L9 TA

GPS NAVIGATION DEVICES\n\nA Global Positioning System (GPS) chip is built into most smartphones and many tablets and other smart devices, but there are also dedicated GPS navigation devices (also called sat navs, for "satellite navigation"). These come in 5-6" models aimed both at in-vehicle use and smaller clip-on devices for walkers and cyclists. GPS devices combine providing an accurate geolocation system with map and local traffic information to allow users to plot routes and help them follow a route with turn-by-turn navigation advice. Some devices use over-the-air radio to provide live traffic information; other models have to be tethered to a smartphone to use its data plan. Most are touchscreen-operated with many models also supporting voice control.\nTag: C1 L9 TA

Activity 9-1\nDiscussing Mobile Device Types\n\nSCENARIO\nAnswer the following questions to check your understanding of the topic.\n\nQuestion 1.\nWhat are the principal characteristics of the phablet form factor?\n\nAnswer 1. A phablet is essentially a smartphone with a screen size of more than approximately 5.5" but less than about 7". Phablets can make voice calls and in this topic, including use cellular data, while many tablets are limited to Wi-Fi connectivity.\n\nQuestion 2. What is the relevance of ARM to smartphones?\n\nAnswer 2. Advanced RISC Machines (ARM) produce the CPU designs most widely used in smartphones.\n\nQuestion 3. True or false? Smartphones use a type of memory technology that works both as system memory and as persistent storage.\n\nAnswer 3. False—like PCs, smartphones use a variant of DDR for system memory. This is volatile storage so a flash memory device is used for persistent storage.\n\nQuestion 4. What is meant by wearable technology?\n\nAnswer 4. Wearable technology is devices that the user doesn't need to hold (as they are affixed to the wearer via a band or clip) to provide uninterrupted interaction between computer and network systems and the user. Examples include Virtual Reality (VR) headsets, smartwatches (such as Apple's iWatch), and fitness monitors like FitBit.\n\nQuestion 5. What technology gives an e-Reader better battery life than a tablet?\n\nAnswer 5. The e-Ink display works without backlighting, producing little to no heat through resistance and better energy efficiency.\nTag: C1 L9 TA A9-1

Topic B\nConnect and Configure Mobile Device Accessories\n\nEXAM OBJECTIVES COVERED\n1001-1.5 Given a scenario, connect and configure accessories and ports of other mobile devices.\n1001-2.7 Compare and contrast Internet connection types, network types, and their features.\n\nMobile devices gain much of their functionality by being able to connect to the user's regular computer. By making the files available on the mobile device, they can  continue working on the files from a mobile device. Being able to connect the mobile device back to the computer might require additional accessories. In this topic, you will examine the connection types and accessories used for mobile devices.\nTag: C1 L9 TB

WIRED CONNECTIONS FOR ACCESSORIES\n\nAlthough mobile devices are designed to be self-contained, there is the need to attach peripheral devices, connect to a computer, or attach a charging cable devices.\n\nAPPLE DOCK AND LIGHTNING CONNECTORS\nOlder Apple devices use a proprietary 30-pin dock connector, enabling connections to various peripheral devices. The dock is also used to charge the battery. A dock-Accessories connector to USB cable facilitates connections to a USB bus (that is, to a PC), though not the connection of USB devices such as hard drives to the iPhone/iPad.\n\nOn the latest Apple devices, the 30-pin dock connector is replaced by an 8-pin Lightning  connector (also proprietary). The Lightning connector is reversible (can be inserted either way up ). There are various Lightning converter cables to allow connections to interfaces such as HDMI, VGA, and SD card readers.\n\nUSB CONNECTORS\nAndroid-based devices usually have a Micro-B USB port for charging and connectivity. You might find older devices using the Mini-B USB port. New devices are quickly adopting the USB-C connector. One issue for Android is that there is no standard way of positioning the connectors, so connections to devices such as speaker or charging docks tend to have to use a cable.\nTag: C1 L9 TB

WIRELESS CONNECTIONS FOR ACCESSORIES\n\nShort-range wireless connectivity is often a better option for mobile devices than wired connections.\n\nBLUETOOTH\nBluetooth is used for so-called Personal Area Networks (PAN) to share data between devices and connect peripheral devices to hosts, such as smartphones and tablets. Bluetooth is a radio-based technology but it is designed to work only over close range. Bluetooth is quoted to work at distances of up to 10 meters (30 feet) for Class 2 devices or 1 meter (3 feet) for Class 3 devices. Devices supporting the Bluetooth 2.0—Enhanced Data Rate (EDR)— standard have a maximum transfer rate of 3 Mbps; otherwise, the maximum rate is 1 Mbps.\n\nNote: Bluetooth 3 supports a 24 Mbps HighSpeed (HS) mode, but this uses a specially negotiated Wi-Fi link rather than the Bluetooth connection itself.\n\nBluetooth needs to be enabled for use via device settings. You may also want to change the device name—remember that this is displayed publicly. Opening the settings page makes the device discoverable to other Bluetooth-enabled devices.\n\n(https://4sorcero.s3.amazonaws.com/byteback/core_1/fig_core_1_464.png)\nEnabling Bluetooth on an Android device. In this figure, the Android device is named "COMPTIA-MOBILE." "COMPTIA" is a nearby Windows PC with Bluetooth enabled.\n\nNFC\nAn increasing range of smartphone models have Near Field Communications (NFC) chips built in. NFC allows for very short range data transmission (up to about 20 cm/8 in) to activate a receiver chip in the contactless credit card reader. The data rates achievable are very low but these transactions do not require exchanging large amounts of information.\n\nNFC allows a mobile device to make payments via contactless Point-of-Sale (PoS) machines. To configure a payment service, the user enters their credit card information into a Mobile Wallet app on the device. The wallet app does not transmit the original credit card information, but a one-time token that is interpreted by the card merchant and linked backed to the relevant customer account. There are three major Mobile Wallet apps: Apple Pay, Android Pay, and Samsung Pay. Some PoS readers may only support a particular type of wallet app or apps.\n\nAs with Bluetooth, NFC can be enabled or disabled via settings. The device must be unlocked to initiate a transaction.\n\nInfraRed (IR)\nMany mobile devices are also equipped with an  sensor or infrared (IR) blaster. This is not used for data connections as such but does allow the device to interact with appliances such as TVs and set-top boxes. An app on the device can be installed to allow the mobile device to be used as a remote control for the appliance.\n\nTETHERING AND MOBILE HOTSPOTS\nTethering refers to using a mobile device's cellular data plan to get Internet access on a PC or laptop (or other device). Not all carriers allow tethering and some only allow it as a chargeable service add-on. Connect the device to the PC via USB or Bluetooth, then configure tethering settings through the Settings→Network menu.\n\n(https://4sorcero.s3.amazonaws.com/byteback/core_1/fig_core_1_465.png)\nConfiguring tethering on an Android phone. The device in this figure is connected to the PC over USB, but you could use Bluetooth too.\n\nIf you want to provide access to more than one device, you can enable the Hotspot Mobile setting. Configure the device with the usual settings for an access point (network name, security type, and passphrase) and then other devices can connect to it as they would any other WLAN.\n\n(https://4sorcero.s3.amazonaws.com/byteback/core_1/fig_core_1_466.png)\nConfiguring mobile hotspot settings (left) then enabling it (right). In this figure, hosts can connect to the COMPTIA-MOBILE-HOTSPOT" network and use the device\'s cellular data plan to get Internet access.\nTag: C1 L9 TB

COMMON MOBILE DEVICE ACCESSORIES\n\nSome popular peripheral options for mobile devices include the following:\n\n(https://4sorcero.s3.amazonaws.com/byteback/core_1/table_core_1_466.png)\n\nExternal keyboard: As the touchscreen keyboards can be quite small and difficult to use, an external keyboard facilitates any extended typing work.\n\nHeadset: Provides audio input/output. As well as being useful for the phone function, some devices support voice recognition. There will usually be an audio connector for headsets or they can be connected via Bluetooth.\n\nSpeaker dock: Allows the device to play audio through external speakers. These can be connected either via the data port, the 3.5 mm audio jack, or more commonly through Bluetooth.\n\nGame pad: Allows the use of a console-type controller (with joystick, cursor pad, and action buttons) with compatible mobile game apps. The game pad will come with some sort of clip to place the smartphone in. It must then be connected via USB or Lightning or paired with the device over Bluetooth. The functionality of the joystick and buttons is configured through each app individually.\n\nMicro-SD (Secure Digital) slot: Allows the device's internal storage to be supplemented with a removable memory card.\n\nDOCKING STATIONS\nAs modern smartphones develop, manufacturers have been able to include processing power to rival some desktops and sometimes even replace them altogether. A smartphone docking station connects the device to a monitor and input devices (keyboard and mouse).\n\n(https://4sorcero.s3.amazonaws.com/byteback/core_1/fig_core_1_467.png)\nExample of a smartphone dock. (Image © 123RF.com.)\n\nPROTECTIVE COVERS AND WATERPROOFING\nAlthough they are made from relatively tough components, mobiles are still prone to damage from dropping, crushing, scratching, or immersion. Rigid or rubber protective covers mitigate this risk a little. Covers can also often function as a stand so that the device can be placed upright on a desk. Many smartphone users also just like to personalize their phone with a cover. A screen protector is a thin but tough film designed to provide extra protection for the display without compromising touch sensitivity.\n\nSome cases are able to provide a degree of waterproofing. Some mobile devices are  designed to be inherently waterproof. Waterproofing is rated on the Ingress Protection (IP) scale. A case or device will have two numbers, such as IP67. The first (6) is a rating for repelling solids, with a 5 or 6 representing devices that are dust protected and dust proof, respectively. The second value (7) is for liquids, with a 7 being protected from immersion in up to 1 m and 8 being protected from immersion beyond 1 m.\n\nNote: If dust protection is unrated, the IP value will be IPX7 or IPX8.\n\nCREDIT CARD READERS\nFor devices with the appropriate port, a credit card reader can be added to a tablet or smartphone. This enables mobile vendors, such as those at festivals or street vendors, to take credit card payments without having a network cable or phone line connected to the credit card reader.\n\nMOBILE POWER\nObviously, smartphones and tablets are primarily designed to work from battery power but can be plugged into building power via the charging cable and adapter. Some devices come with removable battery packs but these are very much the exception rather than the rule. Most vendors try to design their devices so that they will support "typical" usage for a full day without charging.\n\nThe charging speed that can be expected depends on what kind of USB connection is available:\n\n• USB over Type A/B ports and power adapters can supply up to 2.5 W (500 mA at 5 V) for USB 2 or 4.5 W (900 mA at 5 V) for USB 3.\n• Quick Charge (QC) adapters can deliver up to 18 W over USB Type A/B ports.\n• Computer ports and charging adapters using USB-C can nominally supply up to 100 W (5 A at 20 V). Not all devices will be able to draw power at that level, though.\n• Wireless charging (by induction) pads and stands can supply up to 15 W. Most wireless charging devices are based on the Qi standard developed by the Wireless Power Consortium. Some chargers may be capable of charging multiple devices simultaneously.\n• Portable charging banks provide a larger battery, such as 10,000 or 20,000 milliamp hours (mAh), than is found in a typical phone. This allows the phone to be charged from the power pack two or three times before the power pack itself needs recharging. The output of these devices ranges from 2.1 A to about 5 A.\n\nNote: If connected to a computer (or a laptop running on AC power) the device will trickle charge, which takes longer (try disconnecting other USB devices to improve charge times using this method). Also, the Quick Charge standard imposes a phased charging regime to protect battery lifetime (overcharging can reduce the maximum possible charge more quickly). If power is available, the battery is fast-charged to 80% and then trickle charged.\n\nAs the battery ages, it becomes less able to hold a full charge. If it is non-removable, the device will have to be returned to the vendor for battery replacement.\nTag: C1 L9 TB

Activity 9-2\nDiscussing Mobile Device Accessory Connection and Configuration\n\nSCENARIO\nAnswer the following questions to check your understanding of the topic.\n\nQuestion 1.\nWhat type of peripheral port would you expect to find on a current generation smartphone?\n\nAnswer 1. For Apple devices, the Lightning port. For Android and Windows, it will be USB— either Micro Type B or Type-C.\n\nQuestion 2. How would you upgrade storage capacity on a typical smartphone?\n\nAnswer 2. If the smartphone supports removable flash cards such as Micro-SD, you can add a larger card. Otherwise, the components in these devices are not field replaceable, so there are no upgrade options.\n\nQuestion 3. What technology do smartphones use to facilitate payment at points of sale?\n\nAnswer 3. Near Field Communications (NFC) allows the user to touch a receiver for the phone to pass card data to a point of sale terminal.\n\nQuestion 4. True or false? An IP67-rated smartwatch could be considered risk-free for wear while swimming in an indoor pool.\n\nAnswer 4. False—IP67 rates immersion up to 1 m (for up to 30 minutes), so wearing a device while swimming would be a significant risk.\nTag: C1 L9 TB A9-2

Topic C\nConfigure Mobile Device Network Connectivity\n\nEXAM OBJECTIVES COVERED\n1001-1.6 Given a scenario, configure basic mobile device network connectivity and application support.\n1001-2.7 Compare and contrast Internet connection types, network types, and their features.\n1001-3.9 Given a scenario, install and configure common devices.\n\nIn this topic, you will examine some of the features and methods used to connect mobile devices to networks and the Internet.\nTag: C1 L9 TC

CELLULAR DATA NETWORKS\n\nCellular data means connecting to the Internet via the device's cell phone radio and the handset's cellular network provider. The data rate depends on the technology supported by both the phone and the cell tower (3G or 4G, for instance). When a mobile device uses the cellular provider's network, there are likely to be charges based on the amount of data downloaded. These charges can be particularly high when the phone is used abroad (referred to as roaming) so it is often useful to be able to disable mobile data access.\n\n(https://4sorcero.s3.amazonaws.com/byteback/core_1/fig_core_1_470.png)\nCellular data options in iOS (left) and Android (right).\n\nThe indicator on the status bar at the top of the screen shows the data link in use. A device will usually default to Wi-Fi if present and show a signal strength icon.\n\nA device using a cellular data network may show a strength icon for a 4G network or the type of data network (H+ for HSPA+ for instance).\n\nThe cellular data connection can usually be enabled or disabled via the notification shade but there will also be additional configuration options via the Settings menu.\n\nYou can usually set usage warnings and caps and prevent selected apps from using\ncellular data connections.\n\nMOBILE HOTSPOTS AND TETHERING\nAs explained earlier, tethering means connecting another device to a smartphone or tablet via USB or Bluetooth so that it can share its cellular data connection. You can also share the link by configuring the smartphone or tablet as an access point, turning it into a personal or mobile hotspot.\n\n(https://4sorcero.s3.amazonaws.com/byteback/core_1/fig_core_1_471.png)\nConfiguring an iPhone to work as a mobile hotspot.\n\nCELLULAR RADIOS\nA cellular radio makes a connection using the nearest available transmitter (cell or base station). Each base station has an effective range of up to 5 miles (8 km). The transmitter connects the phone to the mobile and landline telephone networks. Cellular radio works in the 850 and 1900 MHz frequency bands (mostly in the Americas) and the 900 and 1800 MHz bands (rest of the world). There are two main cellular radio network types, each developing different standards for the "generations" of cellular data access (2G, 3G, and so on). Global System for Mobile Communication (GSM) is deployed worldwide while Code Division Multiple Access (CDMA) is adopted by carriers in the Americas.\n\nNote: Just to confuse things, GSM radios now use a type of CDMA technology too. In its technical sense, CDMA is a means of exchanging radio signals, it's just that the term CDMA" has become a handy label to distinguish these networks from GSM. Within the US, Sprint and Verizon use CDMA while AT&T and T-Mobile use GSM.\n\nGSM NETWORKS AND SIM CARDS\nGSM works with a Subscriber Identity Module (SIM) card. The user adds the card to the device and the card obtains all the information it needs to connect to the network, including a phone number, radio frequency bands to use, and information about how to connect when roaming in different countries. Updates to this information are pushed" to the card by the network provider so there is never a need to perform a manual update.\n\nUnder GSM, a handset is identified by an International Mobile Station Equipment Identity (IMEI). It is used by the GSM network to identify valid devices and can be used to stop stolen phones from accessing the network, regardless of the SIM used.\n\nThis number is usually printed on a label in the battery compartment on a mobile phone. If it is a sealed case, then the number will be found on the back or bottom of the device. You can also access the IMEI number by dialing *#06# and it will display the IMEI on the device screen. Any phone connected to a GSM network must have the IMEI number stored in the Equipment Identity Register (EIR) database. If a phone is reported as being lost or stolen, the IMEI number is marked to be invalid in the EIR.\n\nA SIM card is registered to a particular user and can be transferred between devices.\n\nThe user is identified by an International Mobile Subscriber Identity (IMSI) number. The number is stored on the SIM card in the format:\n• Three-digit mobile country code.\n• Two-digit mobile network code.\n• Up to 10 digit mobile station identification number.\n\nNote: The IMEI number identifies the device. The IMSI number identifies the subscriber.\n\nAn unlocked handset can be used with any type of SIM card from the user's chosen network provider; a locked handset is tied to a single network provider.\n\nCDMA NETWORKS\nCDMA locks the handset to the original provider and does not require any sort of SIM card. Handsets are identified by a Mobile Equipment ID (MEID). Information that the cellular radio needs to connect to the network is provided as Preferred Roaming Index (PRI) and Preferred Roaming List (PRL) databases.\n\nNote: Handsets from CDMA providers might come with a SIM card but the SIM card is to connect to 4G networks, which are all GSM-based. A handset might also have a SIM card to support roaming when traveling internationally as CDMA networks are not widespread outside the Americas.\n\nBASEBAND UPDATES AND RADIO FIRMWARE\nA baseband update modifies the firmware of the radio modem used for cellular, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, NFC, and GPS connectivity. Radio firmware in a mobile device contains an operating system that is separate from the end-user operating system (for example, Android or iOS). The modem uses its own baseband processor and memory, which boots a Realtime Operating System (RTOS). An RTOS is often used for time-sensitive embedded controllers, of the sort required for the modulation and frequency shifts that underpin radio-based connectivity.\n\nThe procedures for establishing radio connections are complex and require strict compliance with regulatory certification schemes, so incorporating these functions in the main OS would make it far harder to bring OS updates to market. Unfortunately, baseband operating systems have been associated with several vulnerabilities over the years, so it is imperative to ensure that updates are applied promptly. These updates are usually pushed to the handset by the device vendor, often as part of OS upgrades. A handset that has been jailbroken or rooted might be able to be configured to prevent baseband updates or apply a particular version manually, but in the general course of things there is little reason to do so.\n\nNote: Jailbreaking and rooting mean circumventing the usual operation of the mobile OS to obtain super-user or root administrator permissions over the device.\nTag: C1 L9 TC

WI-FI NETWORKS AND HOTSPOTS\n\nNot all mobile devices support cellular radios, but every smartphone and tablet supports a Wi-Fi radio.\n\nIn Android, you can use the notification shade to select a network or open the Wi-Fi settings menus.\n\n(https://4sorcero.s3.amazonaws.com/byteback/core_1/fig_core_1_473.png)\nUsing Android to join a Wi-Fi network (left). The device's network address can be checked using the Advanced Settings page (right).\n\nIn iOS, Wi-Fi networks can be setup via Settings→Wi-Fi. Either select the network name (if it is being broadcast) and credentials or manually configure the SSID and security level (WEP, WPA, or WPA2, for instance).\n\nA hotspot is a location served by some sort of device offering Internet access via Wi-Fi. There are many ways to implement a hotspot:\n• A business may set up an open access point to allow public access (or require payment via a captive portal).\n• A smartphone or tablet might be configured to share its cellular data connection (a personal hotspot).\n• A "Mi-Fi" mobile broadband device is one dedicated to providing a personal hotspot service.\n\nWhen you are using a public hotspot, anyone else joined to the wireless network and the owner of the hotspot can easily intercept traffic passing over it. Consequently, users need to be careful to use SSL/TLS (with a valid digital certificate) to send confidential information to and from web servers and mail clients. Another option is to use a Virtual Private Network (VPN) to protect the browsing session.\nTag: C1 L9 TC

MOBILE VPN CONFIGURATION\n\nA Virtual Private Network (VPN) uses a protocol such as IPSec or  Secure Sockets or Tunneling Protocol (SSTP) to create a tunnel through a carrier network. The contents of the tunnel can be encrypted so that no one with access to the carrier network (such as open access point) can intercept information passing through the VPN.\n\nA mobile VPN is one that can maintain the VPN link across multiple carrier networks, where the IP address assigned to the mobile device may change often. The Mobile VPN app assigns a virtual IP address to connect to the VPN server, then uses any available carrier network to maintain the link. It is also capable of sustaining the link when the device is in sleep mode. Mobile VPNs are usually implemented as third party apps on both Android and iOS devices.\nTag: C1 L9 TC

BLUETOOTH\n\nBluetooth is a short-range (up to about 10 m) radio link, working at a nominal rate of up to about 3 Mbps (for v2.0 + EDR). The latest versions of Bluetooth support a 24 Mbps data rate by negotiating a higher bandwidth link using the Wi-Fi radio. Bluetooth is used for so-called Personal Area Networks (PANs) to share data with a PC, connect to a printer, use a wireless headset, and so on.\n\n(https://4sorcero.s3.amazonaws.com/byteback/core_1/fig_core_1_475.png)\nBluetooth pairing.\n\nIn iOS, Bluetooth devices are configured via Settings→General→Bluetooth. Switch Bluetooth on to make the device discoverable and locate other nearby devices. In Android, you can access Bluetooth settings via the notification shade.\n\nIn Windows, you can manage Bluetooth Devices using the applet in Control Panel or Windows Settings and the Bluetooth icon  in the notification area. The pairing system should automatically generate a passkey when a connection request is received. Input or confirm the key on the destination device and accept the connection.\n\n(https://4sorcero.s3.amazonaws.com/byteback/core_1/fig_core_1_476.png)\nPairing a Windows 10 computer with a smartphone. (Screenshot used with permission from Microsoft.)\n\nTo test the connection, you can simply try use the device—check that music plays through Bluetooth headphones, for example. If you are connecting a device and a Windows PC, you can use the Bluetooth icon or fsquirt command to launch the Bluetooth File Transfer Wizard and enable sending or receiving of a file.\n\nIf you cannot connect a device, check that it has been made discoverable. Another option is to make the computer visible to Bluetooth devices (so that you can initiate a connection from the device rather than from Windows). You should also check that the PC is configured to allow connections (and that the Bluetooth radio is turned on). If you make a computer discoverable, check the pairing list regularly to confirm that the devices listed are valid.\n\nIf you still cannot add or use Bluetooth devices, check that the Bluetooth Support Service is running. Also, consider using  Device Manager to disable power management settings on the Bluetooth adapter and the problematic Bluetooth device.\nTag: C1 L9 TC

AIRPLANE MODE\n\nEach type of wireless radio link can be toggled on or off individually using theControl Center (swipe up from the bottom in iOS) or  notification shade (swipe down from the top in Android). For example, you could disable the cellular data network while leaving Wi-Fi enabled to avoid incurring charges for data use over the cellular network. Most airlines prevent flyers from using radio-based devices while onboard a plane. A device can be put into airplane mode to comply with these restrictions, though some carriers insist that devices must be switched off completely at times such as take-off and landing. Airplane mode disables all wireless features (cellular data, Wi-Fi, GPS, Bluetooth, and NFC). On some devices, some services can selectively be re-enabled while still in airplane mode.\n\n(https://4sorcero.s3.amazonaws.com/byteback/core_1/fig_core_1_477.png)\niOS iPhone (left) and Android phone (right) with Airplane (Aeroplane) mode enabled.\nTag: C1 L9 TC

EMAIL CONFIGURATION OPTIONS\n\nOne of the most important features of mobile devices is the ability to receive and compose email. The settings are configured on the device in much the same way you would set up a mail account on a PC. For example, in iOS, open Settings→Mail, Contacts, Calendars then select Add Account.\n\nCOMMERCIAL PROVIDER EMAIL CONFIGURATION\nMost mobile devices have integrated provider configurations that allow the OS to autodiscover connection settings. Autodiscover means that the mail service has published special Domain Name System (DNS) records that identify how the account for a particular domain should be configured. Many autodiscover-enabled providers will be listed on the device. Choose the mail provider (Exchange, Gmail™, Yahoo!®, Outlook , iCloud , and so on) then enter your email address and credentials and test the connection.\n\n(https://4sorcero.s3.amazonaws.com/byteback/core_1/fig_core_1_478.png)\nConfiguring an autodiscover-enabled Exchange mail account in Android.\n\nCORPORATE AND ISP EMAIL CONFIGURATION\nExchange is usually an integrated provider option and clients can autodiscover the correct settings. To manually configure an Exchange ActiveSync account you need to enter the email address and user name (usually the same thing) and a host address (obtain this from the Exchange administrator) as well as a password and the choice of whether to use SSL (most Exchange servers will require SSL). There is often also a field for domain but this is usually left blank.\n\nNote: If there is a single "Domain\\User Name" field, prefix the email address with a backslash: \\me@company.com.\n\nIf you are connecting to an Internet Service Provider (ISP) or corporate mail gateway that does not support autodiscovery of configuration settings, you can enter the server address manually by selecting  , then inputting the appropriate server addresses:\n• Incoming mail server—Internet Message Access Protocol (IMAP) or Post Office Protocol (POP3).\n\nNote: Choose IMAP if you are viewing and accessing the mail from multiple devices.\nPOP3 will download the mail to the device, removing it from the server mailbox. Note\nthat Exchange doesn't use either POP3 or IMAP (though it can support them) but a\nproprietary protocol called Messaging Application Programming Interface (MAPI).\n\n• Outgoing mail server— Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP).\n• Enable or disable Secure Sockets Layer (SSL).\n\nNote: SSL protects confidential information such as the account password and is necessary if you connect to mail over a public link (such as an open Wi-Fi "hotspot"). Note that you can only enable SSL if the mail provider supports it.\n\n• Ports—the secure (SSL enabled) or unsecure ports used for IMAP, POP3, and SMTP would normally be left to the default. If the email provider uses custom port settings, you would need to obtain those and enter them in the manual configuration.\n\n(https://4sorcero.s3.amazonaws.com/byteback/core_1/fig_core_1_479.png)\nConfiguring an email account manually in iOS.\n\nS/MIME\nConnecting to email servers by using secure ports ensures that the password you use to connect is protected by encryption. It does not provide "end-to-end" encryption of the messages you send, however. Encryption of an actual email message by using digital certificates and digital signatures ensures that a message can be read only by the intended recipient, that the identity of the sender is verified, and that the message has not been tampered with. The main difficulty is that both sender and recipient must agree to use the same (or compatible) encryption products. There are two main standards: Pretty Good Privacy (PGP) and Secure Multipart Internet Mail  Extensions (S/MIME). Both provide similar sorts of functions but use different mechanisms to trust digital identities.\n\nBoth PGP and S/MIME work with digital certificates and public/private key pairs. It is important to understand the two different ways these key pairs are used in an asymmetric encryption system:\n\n• When you sign a message, you use your private key to validate who you are and give the public key related to that private key to anyone you want to communicate with. The public key allows the recipient to verify who you are.\n\n• When you want people to send you messages that only you can read, your public key is used by the sender to encrypt the message. Once encrypted, only your private key can decrypt it (your public key cannot be used to reverse the encryption).\n\nThe encryption keys are stored and exchanged using digital certificates. Each mobile OS has a store for certificates, and for email encryption to work properly, the correct certificates and root certificates must be available to the application. In most scenarios, these would be added to the device using Mobile Device Management (MDM) software.\nTag: C1 L9 TC

Activity 9-3\nDiscussing Mobile Device Network Connectivity Configuration\n\nSCENARIO\nAnswer the following questions to check your understanding of the topic.\n\nQuestion 1. Why would a user be likely to disable cellular data access but leave Wi-Fi enabled?\n\nAnswer 1. To avoid data charges (especially when using the device abroad).\n\nQuestion 2. What is tethering?>>>\n\nAnswer 2. Tethering is the use of a smartphone as an Internet connectivity hub. It can share its Internet connection with a computer via either a cable, Bluetooth, or Wi-Fi.\n\nQuestion 3. What serial number uniquely identifies a particular handset?\n\nAnswer 3. International Mobile Station Equipment Identity (IMEI) for handsets from GSM providers or Mobile Equipment ID (MEID) from CDMA providers.\n\nQuestion 4. What is the function of a smartphone's baseband processor?\n\nAnswer 4. The baseband system is usually dedicated to providing radio modem functions, acting as an interface with the cell tower, access point, or other radio source to transmit signals.\n\nQuestion 5. How do you configure an autodiscover-enabled email provider on a smartphone?\n\nAnswer 5. Just select the provider then enter the email address. If the account is detected, you will be prompted for the password.\n\nQuestion 6. True or false? S/MIME is used to configure a secure connection to a mailbox server, so that your password cannot be intercepted when connecting over an open access point.\n\nAnswer 6. False—S/MIME is for encrypting messages. SSL/TLS is used to secure connections.\nTag: C1 L9 TC A9-3

Activity 9-4\nConfiguring Bluetooth\n\nSCENARIO\nPersonal Area Networks (PAN) are widely used to provide connectivity for wireless\nperipherals, as well as Internet connection tethering and personal hot spots. In this\nactivity, you will practice using Bluetooth to configure a PAN.\n\n 1. Access the settings on the mobile device to determine which wireless connection methods are supported on your mobile device.\n\nNote: Your instructor will provide you with documentation or help guide you through this activity. As mobile devices vary widely, step-by-step directions would not necessarily apply to the devices available to you.\n\nQuestion 2. Create a Bluetooth connection between two Bluetooth capable devices.\na) Enable Bluetooth on the mobile device by using the system settings.\nb) Enable pairing on the device.\nc) On your mobile device, find a device for pairing.\nd) Once the device is found, it will ask for a PIN code.\nDepending on the type of device, the PIN code will be sent via a text, or will be a standard code, such as “0000” used for wireless headsets.\ne) Verify that a connection message has been displayed.\nf) Test the connection by using the two devices together to either transfer data, answer or make a call, or play music.\nTag: C1 L9 TC A9-4

Topic D\nSupport Mobile Apps\n\nEXAM OBJECTIVES COVERED\n1001-1.7 Given a scenario, use methods to perform mobile device synchronization.\n1001-3.9 Given a scenario, install and configure common devices.\n\nData synchronization is the process of automatically merging and updating common data that is stored on multiple devices. For example, a user can access his or her email contacts list from both his or her mobile device and his or her laptop computer. Synchronization is established when the devices are either connected via a cable or wirelessly, or over a network connection. In this topic, you will identify methods and best practices for managing accounts and apps and synchronizing mobile devices.\nTag: C1 L9 TD

MOBILE ACCOUNT SETUP\n\nMost mobile devices have a single user account, configured when the device is used for the first time (or re-initialized). This account is used to manage the apps installed on the device by representing the user on the app store. iOS requires an Apple ID while an Android device requires either a Google Account or a similar vendor account, such as a Samsung Account. This type of account just requires you to select a unique ID (email address) and to configure your credentials (pattern lock, fingerprint, face ID, and so on). Accounts can also be linked to a cellphone number or alternative email address for verification and recovery functions.\n\nNote: Multi-user capability is more useful on tablet devices (for use in the classroom, for instance) than on smartphones. Android has some multi-user functionality. Apple makes classroom deployment software available, but otherwise iOS is single user per device.\n\nAs well as managing the app store, the account can be used to access various services, such as an email account and cloud storage. The user can set up sub-accounts for services not represented by their Apple ID or Google Account, such as a corporate email account. Each app can set up a sub-account, too. For example, your device might have accounts for apps such as Facebook or LinkedIn®.\n\nAccount settings allow you to choose which features of a particular account type are enabled to synchronize data with the device. You can also add and delete accounts from here.\n\n(https://4sorcero.s3.amazonaws.com/byteback/core_1/fig_core_1_484.png)\niOS supports a single Apple ID account per device.

MOBILE APPLICATIONS AND APP STORES\n\nApps are installable programs that extend the functionality of the mobile device. An app must be written and compiled for a particular mobile operating system (Apple iOS, Android, or Windows).\n\nApps are made available for free or can be bought from the App Store. Apps have to be submitted to and approved by Apple before they are released to users. This is also referred as the walled garden model and is designed to prevent the spread of malware or code that could cause faults or crashes. Apps can use a variety of commercial models, including free to use, free with in-app purchases, or paid-for.\n\nThird-party developers can create apps for iOS using Apple's Software Development Kit (SDK) Xcode and the programming language Swift. Xcode can only be installed and run on a computer using macOS®.\n\nNote: There is also an Apple Developer Enterprise program allowing corporate apps to be distributed to employees without having to publish them in the App Store.\n\n(https://4sorcero.s3.amazonaws.com/byteback/core_1/fig_core_1_485a.png)\nApple's App Store and app permission settings. This app is already installed, but an update is available.\n\nANDROID APPS\nAndroid's app model is more relaxed, with apps available from both Google Play™ and third-party sites, such as Amazon's app store. The Java-based SDK (Android Studio) is available on Linux, Windows, and macOS. Apps are supposed to run in a sandbox and have only the privileges granted by the user.\n\n(https://4sorcero.s3.amazonaws.com/byteback/core_1/fig_core_1_485b.png)\nUse the Play Store to install an app (left), grant the app permissions (middle), and review permissions and other settings (right).\n\nAn app will normally prompt when it needs to obtain permissions. If these are not granted, or if they need to be revoked later, you can do this via the app's Settings page.\n\nAndroid also allows third-party or custom programs to be installed directly via an Android Application Package (apk) file, giving users and businesses the flexibility to directly install apps (sideload) without going through the storefront interface. An APK file contains all of that program's code, including .dex files, resources, assets, certificates, and manifest files. Similar to other file formats, APK files can be named almost anything, as long as the file name ends in .apk.\nTag: C1 L9 TD

TYPES OF DATA TO SYNCHRONIZE\n\nMobile device synchronization (sync) refers to copying data back and forth between different devices. This might mean between a PC and smartphone or between a smartphone, a tablet, and a PC. Many people have multiple devices and need to keep information up-to-date on all of them. If someone edits a contact record on a phone, they want the changes to appear when they next log into email on their PC.\n\n(https://4sorcero.s3.amazonaws.com/byteback/core_1/fig_core_1_486.png)\nData synchronization. (Image © 123RF.com.)\n\nThere are many different types of information that users might synchronize and many issues you might face dealing with synchronization problems.\n\nCONTACTS\nA contact is a record with fields for name, address, email address(es), phone numbers, notes, and so on. One issue with contacts is that people tend to create them on different systems and there can be issues matching fields or phone number formats when importing from one system to another using a file format such as Comma Separated Values (CSV). vCard represents one standard format and is widely supported now. Maintaining a consistent, single set of contact records is challenging for most people, whatever the technology solutions available!\n\nCALENDAR\nA calendar item is a record with fields for appointment or task information, such as subject, date, location, and participants. Calendar records have the same sort of sync issues as contacts; people create appointments in different calendars and then have trouble managing them all. Calendar items can be exchanged between different services using the iCalendar format. Another (fairly minor) issue is that the reminders tend to go off on all devices at the same time.\n\nEMAIL\nMost email systems store messages on the server and the client device is used only to manage them (IMAP, Exchange, and web mail, for instance). There can often be sync issues, however, particularly with deletions, sent items, and draft compositions.\n\nPICTURES, MUSIC, AND VIDEO\nThe main sync issue with media files tends to be the amount of space they take up. There might not be enough space on one device to sync all the files the user has stored. There can also be issues with file formats; not all devices can play or show all formats.\n\nDOCUMENTS\nAs with media files, documents can use many different formats (Microsoft Word, PDF, plain text, Open XML, and so on). Users editing a document on different devices may have trouble with version history, unless the changes are saved directly to the copy stored in the cloud.\n\nE-BOOKS\nThere are many apps for purchasing or borrowing e-books and e-magazines or e-newspapers. Often the formats used by different merchants are not interoperable, so multiple e-readers may be required. An e-reader will usually track where you have read to in an e-book, so if you open it on a different device, you can pick up on the page you left off. There are also often facilities for making annotations.\n\nLOCATION DATA\nModern services add geolocation data to pretty much everything. If you use a map or travel planner while signed into the service, your location history is likely to have been recorded, unless you have selected an opt-out.\n\nSOCIAL MEDIA DATA\nThe apps used to manage our online social lives store pretty much all information in the cloud, using local storage for cache only, so the view of your online life from your phone is likely to be pretty much the same as from your PC.\n\nAPPLICATIONS\nWhen you purchase an app from a store, it will be available across all devices you sign in on, as long as they are the same platform. If you have a Windows PC and an Apple iPhone, you will find yourself managing two sets of apps. Most of them will share data seamlessly, however (the social media ones, for instance). Apple has introduced a family sharing feature to allow apps to be shared between different Apple IDs within the same family.\n\nBOOKMARKS\nA bookmark is a record of a website or web page that you visited. Browsers keep an\nautomatic history of bookmarks and you can also create a shortcut (or favorite) manually.\n\nPASSWORDS\nBoth iOS and Android will prompt you to save passwords when you sign in to apps and websites. These passwords are cached securely within the device file system and protected by the authentication and encryption mechanisms required to access the device via the lock screen.\n\nThese cached passwords can be synchronized across your devices using cloud services. You have to remember that anyone compromising your device/cloud account will be able to access any service that you have cached the password for.\nTag: C1 L9 TD

SYNCHRONIZATION METHODS\n\nHistorically, data synchronization would most often take place between a single smartphone and desktop PC. You might use the PC to back up data stored on the smartphone, for instance, or to sync calendar and contact records. Nowadays, it is  much more likely for all our devices to be connected via cloud services. If given permission, the device OS backs up data to the cloud service all the time. When you sign in to a new device, it syncs the data from the cloud seamlessly.\n\niOS SYNCHRONIZATION METHODS\niOS can synchronize with a Windows or Mac computer via the iTunes  program. As with any software, you need to ensure that the computer meets the requirements to install the sync software. The system requirements for these programs are not typically onerous, however. At the time of writing, the principal system requirements for iTunes are a 1 GHz PC with 512 MB RAM, 400 MB free disk space, and Windows 7 or later or any Mac running OS X  or macOS 10.8.5 or later.\n\nThe software may install background services and require these to be running to facilitate connections. For example, iTunes requires the Apple Mobile Device Service to communicate with devices and the Bonjour service to enable some features, such as sharing media libraries.\n\n(https://4sorcero.s3.amazonaws.com/byteback/core_1/fig_core_1_488.png)\nUsing iTunes to sync data between an iPhone and a PC.\n\nOnce iTunes is installed, the device can be connected to the computer via a USB cable (with an Apple Dock or Lightning connector at the iPhone end) or via a Wi-Fi link. The software allows the user to choose what to synchronize with the device. Users can also use iTunes as a means of purchasing apps to be sent to their mobile devices. Another feature of iTunes is the ability to back up, recover, and reinstall firmware on the phone. It is also used to activate the device at the first use.\n\nApple has also the iCloud service, which allows synchronization of devices via a cloud storage facility so that all iOS devices owned by a user with the same ID can share data, photos, music, and contacts.\n\nANDROID SYNCHRONIZATION METHODS\nAndroid-based phones are primarily set up to sync with Google's Gmail email and calendar/contact manager cloud services.\n\n(https://4sorcero.s3.amazonaws.com/byteback/core_1/fig_core_1_488.png)\nAccount settings for the Google master account on an Android smartphone. This account is used for the Play Store and to sync data with other cloud services, but not email, contacts, or calendar.\n\nYou can usually view an Android phone or tablet from Windows over USB or Bluetooth and use drag-and-drop for file transfer (using the Media Transfer Protocol). Some Android vendors have utilities for synchronization similar to iTunes, such as Samsung Kies for Samsung phones.\n\n(https://4sorcero.s3.amazonaws.com/byteback/core_1/fig_core_1_490.png)\nConnecting an Android smartphone to a Windows PC over USB. You can choose whether to allow some sort of data transfer as well as charge the battery. If you enable data transfer, the device's file system will be made available via File Explorer.\n\nThe app doubleTwist provides a means of synching with an iTunes library, and there are various other third-party apps for synching with other programs or using protocols such as File Transfer Protocol (FTP).\n\nMICROSOFT AND THIRD-PARTY SYNCHRONIZATION METHODS\nMicrosoft makes a whole range of cloud services available with a Microsoft account, including free storage space on OneDrive and email/calendar/contact management on Outlook.com. There is also the cloud-based Office suite Office365 with word processing, spreadsheet, and presentation software (amongst others).\n\nApple, Google, and Microsoft obviously make it easy to use "their" cloud services on their" devices, but all produce apps for the different platforms, so you can (for example) run OneDrive on an iPhone if you want. There are also third-party cloud sync and storage services, most notably Dropbox™. You should check the vendor's website for any software requirements for installing the desktop app. For example, Dropbox's desktop app runs on Windows 7 or later, macOS 10.9 or later, Ubuntu™ 14.04 or later, or Fedora 21 or later. There are additional requirements for a supported file system (NTFS, HFS/APFS, or ext4, respectively) and in Linux™, for the presence of various libraries and supporting packages.\n\nSYNCHRONIZING TO AUTOMOBILES\nMost new automobiles come with in-vehicle entertainment and navigation systems. The main part of this system is referred to as the head unit. If supported, a smartphone can be used to "drive" the head unit so the navigation features from your smartphone will appear on the display (simplified for safe use while driving) or you could play songs stored on your tablet via the vehicle's entertainment system. The technologies underpinning this are Apple CarPlay and Android Auto. Typically, the smartphone has to be connected via USB. Both CarPlay Wireless and Android Auto Wireless have been released, and at time of writing, are supported by a few in-vehicle systems.\nTag: C1 L9 TD

MUTUAL AUTHENTICATION FOR MULTIPLE SERVICES\n\nMost service providers want to obtain as much personal data as they can and are consequently hungry for us to register accounts with their apps and websites. Equally, though, many service providers recognize that users don't want to be continually creating multiple accounts on multiple apps or sites and that registration can be a barrier to a user choosing to continue to use the app.\n\nWhat the CompTIA exam objectives describe as Mutual authentication for multiple services (SSO [Single Sign On]) means that one service accepts the credentials from another service. This is more usually described as federated identity management. For example, you could sign into a popular newspaper app using your Facebook credentials. In this scenario, the newspaper does not process the sign in itself and your password is not passed to the newspaper app. Instead, the newspaper app relies on Facebook's web services to authenticate the account and provide authorization information, which the newspaper app then uses to identify you as a previous customer or user.\n\nA true single sign-on environment means that you authenticate once to access many services. This model is typical of enterprise networks and their email, database, and document management applications. Mobile device apps supporting a true single sign-on environment would usually take the device credentials. For example, when you associate your iPhone with an Apple ID (say, david.martin@apple.com) and unlock it, an SSO newspaper app on that iPhone would identify that you are signed in as david.martin@apple.com and load the appropriate profile for you automatically, without requiring you to sign in again. Not many third party apps actually integrate with SSO in this way, but the vendor cloud services work on this basis. For example, when you sign in to Google, you are signing in to email, maps, YouTube, search, and so on.\nTag: C1 L9 TD

Activity 9-5\nDiscussing Mobile App Support\n\nSCENARIO\nAnswer the following questions to check your understanding of the topic.\n\nQuestion 1. Why must a vendor account usually be configured on a smartphone?\n\nAnswer 1. A vendor account, such as an Apple, Google, or Samsung account, is required to use the app store.\n\nQuestion 2. What is sideloading?\n\nAnswer 2. Installing a mobile app without going through the app store. Android supports sideloading through the APK package format. Sideloading is not officially supported on iOS devices.\n\nQuestion 3. Which types of data might require mapping between fields when syncing between applications?\n\nAnswer 3. Contacts and calendar items.\n\nQuestion 4. What software is used to synchronize data files between an iOS device and a PC and what connection methods can it use?\n\nAnswer 4. iTunes. It can work over USB (with a USB-to-Apple cable) or Wi-Fi.\n\nQuestion 5. How might an app register users without implementing its own authentication process?\n\nAnswer 5. Through federated identity management, or as the user sees it, a "Sign in with..." feature. If the user\'s sign-in with the identity service (Google or Facebook, for example) is cached on the device, this will enable Single Sign On (SSO) with supported apps. This could also be referred to as mutual authentication, of a kind (the app and the sign-in provider must authorize one another).\nTag: C1 L9 TD A9-5

Summary\nIn this lesson, you worked with mobile computing devices. You examined mobile device technologies, including smartphones, tablets, wearable devices, and more. As an A+ technician, you will need to be able to expertly support and troubleshoot mobile devices.\n\nQuestion: In your professional experience, have you supported mobile devices? If not, what kind of experience do you have with them?\n\nAnswers will vary, and experience levels can range from no experience at all to power users that are very comfortable with mobile devices.\n\nQuestion: What type of technical support do you think will be expected of an A+ technician as mobile devices become even more prominent within the workplace?\n\nAnswers will vary, but will most likely include implementing security methods and synchronizing organizational data with mobile devices.\nTag: C1 L9 SUMMARY
