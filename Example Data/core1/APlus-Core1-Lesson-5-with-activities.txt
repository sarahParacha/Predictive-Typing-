Lesson 5\nNetwork Infrastructure Concepts\n\nLESSON INTRODUCTION\nIn this lesson, you will learn about the technologies underpinning networking infrastructure, such as network cables, wireless standards, switches, routers, and protocols. Having a basic background in networking fundamentals is a vital prerequisite for providing IT support. In today's environment, standalone computing is a rarity. Just about every digital device on the planet today is connected to external resources via some kind of network, whether it is a small office/home office network, a corporate Wide Area Network (WAN), or directly to the Internet itself. The ability to connect, share, and communicate using a network is crucial for running a business and staying connected to everything in the world, so as a CompTIA® A+® support technician, you will need to understand the technologies that underlie both local and global network communications to ensure that the organization you support stays connected.\n\nLESSON OBJECTIVES\nIn this lesson, you will:\n• Use appropriate tools to select, install, and test network cabling for a given network type.\n• Compare and contrast the functions and features of networking hardware devices.\n• Compare and contrast wireless networking protocols.\n• Compare and contrast Internet connection types.\n• Describe the properties and characteristics of Internet Protocol (IP) addressing and network configuration.\n• Identify the protocols and ports underpinning Internet applications and local network services.\ntag:C1 L5

NETWORK TYPES\nA network is two or more computer systems linked together by some form of transmission medium that enables them to share information. The network technology is what connects the computers, but the purpose of the network is to provide services or resources to its users. Historically, these services have included access to shared files, folders, and printers plus email and database applications. Modern networks are evolving to provide more diverse services, including web applications, social networking, Voice over IP, multimedia conferencing, and Internet of Things connectivity for household devices and appliances.\n\nTo categorize the size and nature of individual networks, the industry has developed terms that broadly define the scope of different types of network.\n\nLOCAL AREA NETWORKS\nOne basic distinction between types of network is between Local Area Networks (LANs) and Wide Area Networks (WANs). A LAN is a self-contained network that spans a small area, such as a single building, floor, or room. In a LAN, all the nodes or hosts participating in the network are directly connected with cables or short-range wireless media. A LAN is typically a single site or possibly several sites in close proximity connected by high-speed backbones. The term campus area network (CAN) is sometimes used for a LAN that spans multiple nearby buildings. Any network where the nodes are within about 1 or 2 km (or about 1 mile) of one another can be thought of as "local."\n\n(https://4sorcero.s3.amazonaws.com/byteback/core_1/fig_core_1_237a.png)\nLANs within a building. (Image © 123RF.com.)\n\nWIDE AREA NETWORKS\nA Wide Area Network (WAN) spans multiple geographic locations. WANs typically connect multiple LANs using long-range transmission media. WANs are usually thought of as relying on some intermediate network, such as the Internet or phone system, to connect geographically diverse LANs. A network where remote users "dial-in" is also a type of WAN.\n\n(https://4sorcero.s3.amazonaws.com/byteback/core_1/fig_core_1_237b.png)\nWide Area Network (WAN). (Image © 123RF.com.)\n\nMETROPOLITAN AREA NETWORKS\nThe term Metropolitan Area Network (MAN) is sometimes used, though it doesn't really have a clear definition other than an area equivalent to a city or other municipality. It could mean a company with multiple connected networks within the same metropolitan area—so, larger than a LAN but smaller than a WAN.\n\n(https://4sorcero.s3.amazonaws.com/byteback/core_1/fig_core_1_238.png)\nMetropolitan Area Network (MAN).

ETHERNET TYPES AND STANDARDS\nMost cabled LANs are based on the Ethernet networking product, developed by the DIX consortium (Digital Equipment Corporation [DEC], Intel, and Xerox). Ethernet standards are now maintained by the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE). Ethernet is technically known by the series of standards produced by the IEEE 802.3 working group. Although the product name is not used in 802.3 standards documentation, it is otherwise universally referred to as Ethernet. There are four broad "types" of Ethernet:\n• 10 Mbps (10BASE-)—this is the original standard, specifying cabling and connectors for copper wire and fiber optic products.\n• Fast Ethernet (100BASE-)—copper wire and fiber optic implementations of 100\n• Gigabit Ethernet (1000BASE-)—1000 Mbps LANs. This has replaced Fast Ethernet as expensive. It is used in the "standard" for a typical LAN.\n• 10G Ethernet (10GBASE-)—10 Gbps links for LANs and WANs, mostly using fiber optic media. 10G Ethernet is widely used in data centers.\n\nThe IEEE 802.11 series of standards (Wi-Fi) are used to implement Wireless Local Area Networks (WLAN) so the technologies complement one another and are often used together in the same network.\n\nEthernet is a very flexible technology. It can support a wide range of different types and sizes of LAN. While a LAN is self-contained, that does not mean that it has to be small. LANs can range from networks with three or four nodes to networks with thousands of nodes. We are going to focus on two particular classes of LAN: SOHO and enterprise.\ntag:C1 L5 TA

COMMON ETHERNET NETWORK IMPLEMENTATIONS\nNetworks can range in size from just a few connected devices in a home environment, to thousands of devices in a large worldwide enterprise.\n\nSOHO NETWORKS\nA SOHO (Small Office Home Office) LAN is a business-oriented network possibly using a centralized server in addition to client devices and printers, but often using a single Internet appliance to provide connectivity. Home and residential networks may also be classed as SOHO.\n\n(https://4sorcero.s3.amazonaws.com/byteback/core_1/fig_core_1_239.png)\nA typical SOHO network layout. (Image © 123RF.com.)\n\nThese Internet appliances provide the following functions:\n• Access point—allows clients with wireless radio adapters to connect to the network.\n• Ethernet switch—connects wired client devices and printers with RJ-45 cables.\n• Internet modem—interfaces with the physical link to the ISP's routers (DSL or cable, for instance).\n• Internet router—forwards communications to and from the Internet Service Provider (ISP) routers to provide Internet access.\n\nENTERPRISE NETWORK ARCHITECTURE\nNetworks supporting larger businesses or academic institutions use the same switch, access point, router, and modem functions as are present in SOHO networks, but> because they must support more clients with a greater degree of reliability, each function is performed by a separate network device. You could think of these larger networks as falling into two categories:\n• SME (Small and Medium Sized Enterprise)—A network supporting tens of users. Such networks would use structured cabling and multiple switches, access points, and routers to provide connectivity.\n• Enterprise LAN—A larger network with hundreds or thousands of servers and clients. Such networks would require multiple enterprise-class switch, access point, and router appliances to maintain performance levels.\n\nThe term Campus Area Network (CAN) is sometimes used for a LAN that spans multiple nearby buildings.\n\nThe following graphic illustrates how network appliances might be positioned in an enterprise LAN. Client devices are located in work areas, which are connected to the network by cabling running through wall conduit and patch panel or by wireless access points. Workgroup switches connect these devices to core/distribution switches and routers, which provide access to network servers, printers, and Internet services. Internet services run in protected Demilitarized Zones (DMZ) to provide Internet access for employees, email and communications, remote access via Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), and web services for external clients and customers.\n\n(https://4sorcero.s3.amazonaws.com/byteback/core_1/fig_core_1_240.png)\nPositioning network components.

TWISTED PAIR CABLING AND CONNECTORS\nMost cabled LANs use a type of copper wire called twisted pair as transmission media.\n\nUNSHIELDED TWISTED PAIR (UTP) CABLE\nUnshielded Twisted Pair (UTP) is the type of cabling most widely used for computer networking. With the type of UTP used for Ethernet, the cable contains four copper conductor "pairs." Each conductor has an insulating sheath. Each pair of conductors is twisted, which reduces interference between the wires (crosstalk) and interference from other electromagnetic sources, referred to as Electromagnetic Interference (EMI). Each pair is twisted at a different rate to further reduce interference. The signals sent over each pair are balanced. This means that each wire carries an equal but opposite signal to its pair. This is another factor helping to identify the signal more strongly against any source of interference.\n\nThe four pairs are covered by a protective outer jacket. The insulation sheaths and jacket are usually made of (PVC).\n\nUTP works well where there are no powerful interference sources, but the electrical signaling method has limited range. The signal is said to suffer from attenuation, meaning that it loses power quickly over long ranges (above 100 m).\n\n(https://4sorcero.s3.amazonaws.com/byteback/core_1/fig_core_1_241.png)\nUTP cable. (Image © 123RF.com.)\n\nCAT STANDARDS\nThe number of twists is one factor in determining the speed and transmission limitations of the cable. Twisted pair cable is rated for different Ethernet applications according to "Cat" specifications, defined in the TIA/EIA-568-C Commercial Building Telecommunications Cabling Standards.\n\n(https://4sorcero.s3.amazonaws.com/byteback/core_1/table_core_1_241.png)\n\nCat Frequency Capacity Max. Distance Network Application\n5 100 MHz 100 Mbps 100 m (328 ft) 100BASE-TX\n5e 100 MHz 1 Gbps 100 m (328 ft) 1000BASE-T\n6 250 MHz 1 Gbps 100 m (328 ft) 1000BASE-T\n6 250 MHz 10 Gbps 55 m (180 ft) 10GBASE-T\n6A 500 MHz 10 Gbps 100 m (328 ft) 10GBASE-T\n\nNote: Vendors sometimes label Cat 6A cable as "Cat 6e" because Cat 5e followed Cat 5. The "A" stands for "augmented."\n\nCat 5 cable is no longer available. Cat 5e is tested at 100 MHz—as Cat 5 was—but to higher overall specifications for attenuation and crosstalk, meaning that the cable is rated to handle Gigabit Ethernet throughput. Cat 5e would still be an acceptable choice for providing network links for workstations. Cat 6 can support 10 Gbps, but over shorter distances. Cat 6A is an improved specification cable with the ability to support 10 Gbps over 100 m. It is mostly deployed in data centers or as backbone cabling between servers and network appliances.\n\nNote: Cabling is not the only part of the wiring system that must be rated to the appropriate category. For faster network applications (Gigabit Ethernet and better), the performance of connectors becomes increasingly critical. For example, if you are installing Cat 6A wiring, you must also install Cat 6A patch panels, wall plates, and connectors.\n\nSHIELDED TWISTED PAIR (STP)\nWhen twisted pair cabling was first used in networks based on IBM's Token Ring product, it was usually shielded to make it less susceptible to interference and crosstalk. Each pair was surrounded by a braided shield. This cable construction is referred to as Shielded Twisted Pair (STP). STP is bulky and difficult to install, so where a degree of protection from interference is required, modern twisted pair the terms are still used cabling installations use screened cables, meaning a shield positioned around all pairs. There are many different ways of designating different types of shielding. Most Cat 5e/6/6A cable is available in shielded variants, notably F/UTP and U/FTP:\n• F/UTP—with a foil screen around all pairs, often also designated ScTP.\n• U/FTP—with foil shielding for each pair.\n\n(https://4sorcero.s3.amazonaws.com/byteback/core_1/fig_core_1_242.png)\nF/UTP cable with a foil screen surrounding unshielded pairs. (Image by Baran Ivo and released to public domain.)\n\nLegacy STP cable could be more complex to install as it required bonding each element to ground manually but modern screened and shielded solutions (using appropriate cable, connectors, jacks, and patch panels) reduce this complexity by incorporating grounding within the design of each element.\n\nPLENUM CABLE\nA plenum space is a void in a building designed to carry Heating, Ventilation, and Air Conditioning (HVAC) systems. Plenum space is typically a false ceiling, though it could also be constructed as a raised floor. As it makes installation simpler, this space has also been used for communications wiring in some building designs. Plenum space is an effective conduit for fire, as there is plenty of airflow and no fire breaks, such as walls and doors. If the plenum space is used for heating, there may also be higher temperatures. Therefore, building regulations require the use of fire-retardant plenum cable in such spaces. Plenum cable must not emit large amounts of smoke when burned, be self-extinguishing, and meet other strict fire safety standards.\n\nGeneral purpose (non-plenum) cabling uses PVC (polyvinyl chloride) jackets and insulation. Plenum-rated cable uses treated PVC or Fluorinated Ethylene Polymer (FEP). This can make the cable less flexible but the different materials used have no effect on bandwidth. Data cable rated for plenum use under the US National Electrical Code (NEC) is marked CMP/MMP. General purpose cables are marked CMG/MMG or CM/MP.\ntag:C1 L5 TA

WIRING STANDARDS FOR TWISTED PAIR\n\nTwisted pair cabling for Ethernet is terminated using modular RJ-45 connectors. RJ-45 connectors are also referred to as 8P8C, standing for 8-position/8-contact. Each conductor in 4-pair Ethernet cable is color-coded. Each pair is assigned a color (Blue, Orange, Green, or Brown). The first conductor in each pair has a predominantly white insulator with stripes of the color; the second conductor has an insulator with the solid color.\n\n(https://4sorcero.s3.amazonaws.com/byteback/core_1/fig_core_1_243.png)\nTwisted pair RJ-45 connectors. (Image © 123RF.com.)\n\nThe ANSI/TIA/EIA 568 standard defines two methods for terminating RJ-45 connectors: T568A and T568B. The wiring for T568A is shown in the previous figure. In T568B, pin 1 is wired to Orange/White, pin 2 is wired to Orange, pin 3 is wired to Green/White, and pin 6 is wired to Green or, put another way, the orange and green pairs are swapped over.\n\nA normal—or straight through—Ethernet cable is wired with the same type of termination at both ends. Using T568A at one end and T568B at the other creates a crossover cable. Crossover cables were once used to connect computers directly, but Gigabit Ethernet interfaces can perform the crossover automatically, even if standard cable is used.\n\nOrganizations should try to avoid using a mixture of the two standards. It is difficult to say whether one is more prevalent than the other. T568A is mandated for US government premises and by the residential cabling standard (TIA 570).\ntag:C1 L5 TA

PATCH PANELS AND STRUCTURED CABLING\nA Gigabit Ethernet link using twisted pair cabling can be up to 100 m (328 feet) long. This means there must be no more than 100 m of cabling between the switch and the computer. There is also a distinction between solid and stranded cabling.\n\nSolid cabling uses a single thick wire for each conductor. Solid cable is used for permanent" links, such as cable running through walls. This is often also called drop cable,  as the installer drops the cable through the wall void to the hole cut out for the port. This cable links the RJ-45 port on a wall plate with a patch panel. Rather than using modular RJ-45 connectors, solid cable terminates in Insulation Displacement Connectors (IDC) at the back of the wall plate and patch panel, as shown here.\n\nThe other side of the patch panel has pre-wired RJ-45 ports. A patch cord is used to connect a port on the patch panel to a port on the switch. A patch cord is made using stranded cable, which comprises lots of very thin wires twisted to make a single conductor. This makes the cable much more flexible but less efficient. A patch cord is not supposed to be longer than 5 m.\n\n(https://4sorcero.s3.amazonaws.com/byteback/core_1/fig_core_1_244.png)\nPatch panel with prewired RJ-45 ports. (Image © 123RF.com.)\n\nA second patch cord is used between the computer's network adapter and the wall port. This use of patch cords, permanent links, and patch panels is referred to as a structured cabling system.\n\nNote: It is vital to use an effective labeling system when installing this type of network so that you know which patch panel port is connected to which wall port.\ntag:C1 L5 TA

CABLE INSTALLATION AND TESTING TOOLS\nYou could fill a small van and spend a not-so-small fortune on the various tools available for installing and maintaining data cabling. The range of tools you require will of course depend on the cabling work you do, but the following can be considered typical.\n\nWIRE STRIPPER/CUTTER\nElectrician's scissors (snips) are designed for cutting copper wire and stripping insulation and cable jackets. Alternatively, there are dedicated tools or tools that have replaceable blades for different data cable types. Cable cutting blades should be rounded to preserve the wire geometry. Stripping tools should have the correct diameter to score a cable jacket without damaging the insulation around each wire.\n\n(https://4sorcero.s3.amazonaws.com/byteback/core_1/fig_core_1_245a.png)\nA cable stripper. (Image by gasparij © 123RF.com.)\n\nPUNCH-DOWN TOOL\nThese tools fix conductors into an IDC. The wire pairs are untwisted and laid in the terminals in the IDC in the appropriate termination order (T568A or T568B). It is important not to untwist the pairs too much, however. The punch-down tool then presses the wire into the terminal, cutting through the insulation to make an electrical contact. There are different IDC formats (66, 110, and Krone) and these require different blades. Many punch-down tools have replaceable blades.\n\n(https://4sorcero.s3.amazonaws.com/byteback/core_1/fig_core_1_245b.png)\nA punch-down tool. (Image by gasparij © 123RF.com.)\n\nCRIMPERS\nThese tools fix a jack to a cable. As with an IDC, the wires are laid in the appropriate terminals in the jack and the crimper tool then closes and seals the jack. The tools are specific to a particular type of connector and cable, though some may have modular dies to support a range of RJ-type jacks.\n\n(https://4sorcero.s3.amazonaws.com/byteback/core_1/fig_core_1_246.png)\nA wire crimper. (Image by gasparij © 123RF.com.)\n\nNote: It is best to use prefabricated patch cords where possible. These are far less likely to create problems.\n\nCABLE TESTING TOOLS\nThe best time to verify wiring installation and termination is just after you have made all the connections. This means you should still have access to the cable runs. Identifying and correcting errors at this point will be much simpler than when you are trying to set up end user devices. When troubleshooting a cabled network link, you may need to consider:\n• The patch cord between the PC and the wall port.\n• The wall port and the cabling in the wall.\n• The port on the patch panel and the patch cord to the switch port.\n\nTest patch cords by substitution with a "known good" one. If the problem is not caused by the patch cord and you can rule out configuration errors, you need to start testing the structured links. There are a number of network cabling and infrastructure troubleshooting devices to assist with this process.\n\nA multimeter can be used as a basic cable testing tool. The primary purpose of a multimeter is for testing electrical circuits, but you can use one to test for the continuity of any sort of copper wire, the existence of a short, and the integrity of a terminator. To perform useful tests, you need to know the readings that are expected from a particular test. For example, if the resistance measured across UTP Ethernet cable is found to be 100 ohms, then the cable is OK, but if the resistance between the two ends of a cable is infinity, then the cable has a break. Many multimeters designed for ICT use incorporate the function of a wire map tester. These are also available as dedicated devices. Wire map testers can identify wiring problems that a simple continuity test will not detect, such as transpositions and reversed pairs.\n\n(https://4sorcero.s3.amazonaws.com/byteback/core_1/fig_core_1_247a.png)\nMultimeter. (Image by Norasit Kaewsai © 123RF.com.)\n\nMore advanced cable testers provide detailed information on the physical and electrical properties of the cable. For example, they test and report on cable conditions, crosstalk, attenuation, noise, resistance, and other characteristics of a cable run. Devices classed as certifiers can be used to test and certify cable installations to a particular performance category (for example, that a network is TIA/EIA 568-C Category 6 compliant). They use defined transport performance specifications to ensure an installation exceeds the required performance characteristics for parameters such as attenuation and crosstalk.\n\n(https://4sorcero.s3.amazonaws.com/byteback/core_1/fig_core_1_247b.png)\nA cable tester. (Image by Vladimir Zhupanenko © 123RF.com.)\n\nTONE GENERATOR AND PROBE\nA tone generator and probe tool is used to trace a cable from one end to the other. This may be necessary when the cables are bundled and have not been labeled properly. This device is also known as a "Fox and Hound" or "toner and probe." The tone generator is used to apply a signal on the cable. The probe is used to detect the signal and follow the cable over ceilings and through ducts or identify it from within the rest of the bundle.\n\nTo locate a cable in a group of cables, connect the tone generator to the copper ends of the wires, then move the tone locator over the group of cables. A soft beeping tone indicates that you are close to the correct wire set; when the beeping is loudest, you have found the cable.\n\nNote: Do not connect a tone generator to a cable that is connected to a NIC. The signal sent by the tone generator can destroy network equipment.\n\nLOOPBACK PLUGS\nA loopback plug is used to test a port. It involves connecting pin 1 to pin 3 and pin 2 to pin 6. You can do this either by rewiring the jack or twisting the relevant pairs together on a cable stub. Alternatively, you can purchase a prefabricated loopback plug. When you connect a loopback plug to a port, you should see a solid connection LED. You can also use the plug in conjunction with diagnostic software.\n\n(https://4sorcero.s3.amazonaws.com/byteback/core_1/fig_core_1_248a.png)\nA loopback plug. (Image © 123RF.com.)\ntag:C1 L5 TA

FIBER OPTIC CABLING AND CONNECTORS\nCopper wire carries electrical signals, which are subject to interference and attenuation. Light signals are not susceptible to interference, cannot easily be intercepted (eavesdropped), and suffer less from attenuation. Consequently, fiber optic cabling can support much higher bandwidth, measured in multiple gigabits or terabits per second, and longer cable runs, measured in miles rather than feet.\n\n(https://4sorcero.s3.amazonaws.com/byteback/core_1/fig_core_1_248b.png)\nA fiberoptic strand. (Image © 123RF.com.)\n\nAn optical fiber consists of an ultra-fine core of glass to carry the light signals surrounded by glass or plastic cladding, which guides the light pulses along the core, and a protective coating called the buffer. The fiber optic cable is contained in a protective jacket and terminated by a connector.\n\nFiber optic cables fall into two broad categories: single-mode and multi-mode:\n• Single-Mode Fiber (SMF) has a small core (8-10 microns) and is designed to carry a long wavelength, near infrared (1310 or 1550 nm) light signal, generated by a laser. Single-mode cables support data rates up to 10 Gbps or better and cable runs of many kilometers, depending on the quality of the cable and optics.\n• Multi-mode (MMF) has a larger core (62.5 or 50 microns) and is designed to carry a shorter wavelength light (850 nm or 1300 nm) transmitted in multiple waves of varying length. MMF uses less expensive optics and consequently is less expensive to deploy than SMF. However, it does not support such high signaling speeds or long distances as single-mode and so is more suitable for LANs than WANs.\n\nA number of connectors have been designed for use with fiber optic cabling. Some types are more popular for multi-mode and some for single-mode. Connectors for MMF are usually color-coded beige while those for SMF are blue. The core of each connector is a ceramic or plastic ferrule that ensures continuous reception of the light signals.\n• Straight Tip (ST)—A bayonet-style connector that uses a push-and-twist locking mechanism; used mostly for multi-mode networks.\n• Subscriber Connector (SC)—Connector with a push/pull design that allows for simpler insertion and removal than FC. There are simplex and duplex versions, though the duplex version is just two connectors clipped together. It can be used for single- or multi-mode.\n• Lucent or Local Connector (LC) —A small form factor connector with a tabbed push/pull design. LC is similar to SC but the smaller size allows for higher port density.\n\n(https://4sorcero.s3.amazonaws.com/byteback/core_1/fig_core_1_249.png)\nPatch card with duplex SC format connectors (left) and LC connectotrs (right). (Image by YANAWUT SUNTORNKIJ © 123RF.com.)\n\nPatch cords for fiber optic can come with the same connector on each end (ST-ST, for instance) or a mix of connectors (ST-SC, for instance). Fiber optic connectors are quite easy to damage and should not be repeatedly plugged in and unplugged.\n\nNote: To protect your eyesight, do not look directly into a fiber optic port.\ntag:C1 L5 TA

COAXIAL CABLING AND CONNECTORS\nCoaxial, or coax cable is a different type of copper cabling, also carrying electrical signals. Where twisted pair uses balancing to cancel out interference, coax uses two conductors that share the same axis. The core signal conductor is enclosed by plastic insulation (dielectric) then a second wire mesh conductor serves both as shielding from EMI and as a ground.\n\n(https://4sorcero.s3.amazonaws.com/byteback/core_1/fig_core_1_250a.png)\nDetailed layers of a coaxial cable. (Image by destinacigdem © 123RF.com.)\n\nCoax cables are categorized using the Radio Grade (RG) "standard." The Radio Grade (or Radio Guide) classifications were developed by the US military but are no longer actively maintained by any sort of standards body. They do not prescribe the quality of coax cabling but categorize it by the thickness of the core conductor and the cable's characteristic impedance.\n• RG-6 cable has a thicker core conductor for better signal quality and is often used as a drop/patch cable for modern Cable Access TV (CATV) and broadband cable modems.\n• RG-59 cable has a thinner core conductor and was used as a drop cable for older CATV/cable modem installs and is also used for CCTV cabling. Coax cabling is also available with tri- or quad-shielding for better resistance to EMI and eavesdropping.\n\nIn most cases, BNC (alternately Bayonet-Neill-Concelman, British Naval Connector, or Barrel Nut Connector) connectors are crimped to the ends of the cable. The impedance of the connector must match the cable type (50 or 75 ohm).\n\n(https://4sorcero.s3.amazonaws.com/byteback/core_1/fig_core_1_250b.png)\nAn example of a coaxial F-connector (left) and a BNC connector (right). (Image © 123RF.com.)\n\nCoax installations also use screw-down F-connectors. A broadband cable service, for example, is likely to use the F-connector for drop cables.\n\nAs an Ethernet LAN media product (10BASE-5/Thicknet and 10BASE-2/Thinnet), coax could support 10 Mbps with cable lengths of up to 500 m and 185 m, respectively. Coax is considered obsolete in terms of LAN applications but is still widely used for CCTV networks and as drop cables for cable TV (CATV) and Internet access, where it can support higher bandwidths but at reduced range. In a Hybrid Fiber Coax (HFC) network, coax cable links the fiber optic trunk serving the whole street to the cable modem" installed in the customer\'s premises. Coax suffers less from attenuation than twisted pair but is generally bulkier and more difficult to install.\ntag:C1 L5 TA

Activity 5-1\nDiscussing Wired Networks\n\nSCENARIO\nAnswer the following questions to check your understanding of the topic.\n\nQuestion 1. Your company has a global presence, and all locations can communicate. At each site, there is a network, and that network connects to the overall organizational network. In some locations, there are multiple sites within a city. Identify each type of network described here.\n\nAnswer 1. The global network is a WAN. The network at each site is a LAN. The sites within a city comprise a MAN.\n\nQuestion 2. You are performing a wiring job, but the company wants to purchase the media and components from another preferred supplier. The plan is to install a network plenum cable, straight-through vs. crossover using copper cabling that will support Gigabit Ethernet. The customer is about to purchase Cat5e cable spools. Is this the best choice?\n\nAnswer 2. Cat5e will meet the requirement and will cost the least. Cat6 might offer better performance without adding too much cost. Cat6A would be the best choice for supporting future requirements, but it is likely to cost more than the customer is budgeting for. You should also notify the customer if plenum-rated cabling will be required.\n\nQuestion 3. What is the significance of network cabling marked "CMP/MMP"?\n\nAnswer 3. The cable is plenum cable, rated for use in plenum spaces (building voids used with HVAC systems).\n\nQuestion 4. You need to connect cable wires to a patch panel. Which networking tool might help you?\n\nAnswer 4. A punch down tool. Remember that punch down tools are used to terminate solid core cabling to Insulation Displacement Connector (IDC) blocks in patch panels and wall plates, while crimpers are used to attach RJ-45 jacks to stranded patch cord cabling.\n\nQuestion 5. What type of tool provides comprehensive information about the properties of a network cable installation?\n\nAnswer 5. A cable certifier.\n\nQuestion 6. What features of fiber optic cable make it more suitable for WANs than copper cabling?\n\nAnswer 6. It suffers less attenuation (and therefore longer range) and is immune to EMI and eavesdropping.\n\nQuestion 7. What types of connector are often used with coaxial cable?\n\nAnswer 7. BNC connectors and F-connectors.\ntag:C1 L5 TA A5-1

Topic B\nNetwork Hardware Devices\n\nEXAM OBJECTIVES COVERED\n1001-2.2 Compare and contrast common networking hardware devices.\nIn this topic, you will identify several types of network devices and other components.\nNetwork adapters, Internet modems, switches, and routers are fundamental network\nconnectivity devices, and you will often encounter them in the network environments that you support. Understanding the functions and capabilities of these devices will prepare you to support a wide variety of network environments.\ntag:C1 L5 TB

NETWORK INTERFACE CARDS\nCommunications are transported over an Ethernet cable by electrical signaling in the case of twisted pair, or light signaling in the case of fiber optic. The physical connection to the network media is made using a port in the computer's network adapter or Network Interface Card (NIC). For the NIC to be able to transmit and receive the signals and process them as digital data, they must be divided into regular units with a consistent format. There must also be a means for each node on the local network to address communications to another node. Ethernet provides a data link protocol to perform these framing and addressing functions.\n\nThe signaling mechanism uses various encoding methods to represent the 1s and 0s of computer data as electrical or light pulses. The transceiver in the NIC is responsible for transmitting and receiving these pulses in the agreed frame format.\n\nFRAMES\nEach frame is identified by a preamble sequence, which is basically a warning to the NIC to expect a new frame. A frame is formatted with control information in the form of header fields, each of a fixed size and presented in a fixed order. The most important fields are the destination and source addresses of the adapter to which the frame is being directed and the adapter from which it was sent. Other information (not shown in the following simplified figure) includes the frame length and network layer protocol identifier.\n\nFollowing these fields comes the payload. This is the data that is being transported over the network. It will normally consist of a network packet, such as an Internet Protocol (IP) packet, with its own headers and payload. Putting layers of packets within <one another like this is called encapsulation.\n\nThe frame finishes with a checksum. The receiving computer can calculate its own checksum and compare it to this value. If they do not match, the receiving host rejects the frame as damaged.\n\n(https://4sorcero.s3.amazonaws.com/byteback/core_1/fig_core_1_254.png)\nConstruction of a frame.\ntag:C1 L5 TB

ETHERNET NIC FEATURES\nMost motherboards come with an onboard Ethernet network adapter. An additional or replacement NIC could also be installed as a PCIe expansion card if the onboard adapter is not suitable for a particular network implementation.\n\nAll onboard cards support copper-based Ethernet with RJ-45 ports. You might use an add-in card to support other types of Ethernet, notably fiber optic. Some cards support more than one type of connector. You can also purchase cards with multiple ports of the same type—two or four Gigabit RJ-45 Ethernet ports, for instance. The multiple ports can be bonded to create a higher speed link. Four Gigabit Ethernet ports could be bonded to give a nominal link speed of 4 Gbps.\n\n(https://4sorcero.s3.amazonaws.com/byteback/core_1/fig_core_1_255.png)\nA network interface card. (Image © 123RF.com.)\n\nMEDIA ACCESS CONTROL (MAC) ADDRESS\nEach Ethernet network adapter port has a unique hardware or physical address known as the Media Access Control (MAC) address. MAC addresses provide the value used in a frame's source and destination address fields. A MAC address consists of 48 binary digits (6 bytes). This is typically represented as 12 digits of hexadecimal with colon or hyphen separators or no separators at all—for example, 00:60:8c:12:3a:bc or 00608c123abc.\n\nNIC LED STATUS DIODES\nNetwork adapters typically have one or more Light Emitting Diode (LED) status lights that can provide information on the state of the network connection.\n• Most adapters have a link light that indicates if there is a signal from the network. If the link light is not lit, there is generally a problem with the cable or the physical connection.\n• Most adapters also have an activity light that flickers when packets are received or sent. If the light flickers constantly, the network might be overused or there might be a device generating network noise.\n• Some multi-speed adapters have a speed light to show whether the adapter is operating at 10 Mbps (Ethernet), 100 Mbps (Fast Ethernet), or 1000 Mbps (Gigabit Ethernet).\n• Some types of equipment combine the functions of more than one light into dual-color LEDs. For example, a green flickering light might indicate normal activity, whereas an orange flickering light indicates network traffic collisions.\ntag:C1 L5 TB

LEGACY NETWORKING DEVICES\nIn a structured cabling system, the computer is connected to a wall port and—via cabling running through the walls—to some sort of patch panel. The port on the patch panel is then connected to a port on the switch. The switch is the network appliance that "ties" the whole local network together. However, while switches are the appliances at the core of most modern Ethernet networks, you should also be aware of the basic function of legacy appliances, such as hubs and bridges.\n\nHUBS AND REPEATERS\nA hub is an early type of device used to implement the Ethernet cabling design, referred to as a star topology. The hub contains a number of ports—typically between 4 and 48—to provide connections for network devices. A hub simply ensures that all devices receive signals put on the network, working as a multiport repeater.\n\n(https://4sorcero.s3.amazonaws.com/byteback/core_1/fig_core_1_256.png)\nUsing a hub to implement a physical star topology. Node A transmits a signal, which is received by the hub and forwarded out of each other port for reception bu all the other nodes.  (Image © 123RF.com.)\n\nA repeater is a device used to overcome the distance limitations imposed by network cabling. It receives a transmission arriving over one cable segment and then regenerates and retransmits it at the original strength over another cable segment. Note: Standalone repeater devices are still widely used. On fiber optic networks it is often necessary to use repeaters on long-distance communications cabling.\n\nBRIDGES\nA bridge is a device that divides a local network into two or more segments. Hosts on one segment are able to communicate with those on another segment only via the> bridge.  Contention arises in hub-based Ethernet because all communications are received by all computers connected to the hub. The hub just repeats all transmissions across all ports. A lot of the communications are unnecessary and a lot of them collide." When there is a collision, all the nodes have to stop and resend frames, slowing the network down. The network segment in which these collisions occur is called a collision domain. Any nodes attached to a hub are in a single collision domain.\n\nA bridge can be used to divide an overloaded network into separate collision domains. The bridge keeps track of the MAC addresses attached to each segment. The bridge only passes signals from one segment to another if there is a match to the destination MAC address, reducing traffic loads in any one segment. The network should be designed so that relatively little traffic actually needs to pass over the bridge.\n\n(https://4sorcero.s3.amazonaws.com/byteback/core_1/fig_core_1_257a.png)\nBridge operation—the bridge tracks MAC addresses associated with each port and only forwards communications out of the port associated with the destination MAC address.

SWITCHES\nNeither hub nor bridge appliances are widely used on networks anymore. Their functions have been replaced by Ethernet switches. Like hubs, switches can connect nodes together in a single network, repeating and regenerating signals over multiple ports. Like bridges, switches are used to reduce the effect of contention on network performance.\n\n(https://4sorcero.s3.amazonaws.com/byteback/core_1/fig_core_1_257b.png)\nA workgroup switch. (Image © 123RF.com.)\n\nMICROSEGMENTATION\nAn Ethernet switch performs the same sort of function as a bridge but can provide many more ports. Bridges only came with up to 4 ports. A single switch might have up to 48 ports and multiple switches can be connected together to create a switched fabric with thousands of ports. Each switch port is a separate collision domain. In effect, the switch establishes a point-to-point link called a virtual circuit between any two network nodes. This is referred to as microsegmentation. It works as follows:\n1. Computer A transmits a frame intended for Computer B.\n2. The switch receives the frame into a port buffer and reads the destination MAC address from the Ethernet frame.\n3. The switch uses its MAC address table to look up the port connected to the destination MAC address.\n4. The switch uses its high speed backplane to send the frame out on port 3 for computer B to receive.\n5. The other connected devices, such as host C, observe any activity on the network while this process takes place. Therefore, these other devices are able to transmit and receive at the same time.\n\n(https://4sorcero.s3.amazonaws.com/byteback/core_1/fig_core_1_258.png)\nSwitch operation. (Image © 123RF.com.)\n\nBecause each port is in a separate collision domain, collisions can only occur if the port is operating in half-duplex mode. This would only occur if a legacy network card or a hub is attached to it. Even then, collisions only affect the segment between the port and that adapter—they do not slow down the whole network. For other devices, the network appears free, so they are able to send communications at the same time using the full bandwidth of the network media.\n\nNote: Half duplex means that a port can either send or receive but cannot do both at the same time. Ports supporting Gigabit Ethernet can send and receive at the same time (full duplex).\n\nNote: You are very unlikely to come across hub or bridge appliances. The vast majority of Ethernet networks are implemented using switches. Gigabit Ethernet can only run using switches. Note that the function of a bridge is still an important one, though. For example, a PC might use a software bridge between network adapters (for network connectivity when the host is running virtualization software, for instance).\ntag:C1 L5 TB

MANAGED AND UNMANAGED SWITCHES\nAn unmanaged switch performs the microsegmentation function described previously without requiring any sort of configuration. You just power it on, connect some hosts to it, and it works without any more intervention. You might find unmanaged switches with four or eight ports used in small networks. There is also an unmanaged switch embedded in most of the Internet router/modems supplied by Internet Service Providers (ISP) to connect to their networks.\n\nLarger workgroups and corporate networks require additional functionality in their switches. Switches designed for larger LANs are called managed switches. A managed switch will work as an unmanaged switch out-of-the-box, but an administrator can connect to it over a management port, configure security settings, and then choose options for the switch's more advanced functionality.\n\n(https://4sorcero.s3.amazonaws.com/byteback/core_1/fig_core_1_259.png)\nModular chassis allows provisioning multiple access switches. (Image © 123RF.com.)\n\nOne of the main reasons for using managed switches is that enterprise networks might have to provide hundreds or thousands of access ports. This is accomplished by linking multiple switches together. Having that many ports on the same network creates its own performance and security issues, so managed switches support a method of dividing the ports into separate Virtual LANs (VLANs).\n\nConfiguration of a managed switch can either be performed over a web interface or some sort of command line.\n\n(https://4sorcero.s3.amazonaws.com/byteback/core_1/fig_core_1_260.png)\nViewing interface configuration on a Cisco switch.\ntag:C1 L5 TB

POWER OVER ETHERNET\nPower over Ethernet (PoE) is a means of supplying electrical power from a switch port over Cat 5 or better data cabling to a connected powered device, such as a tablet computer, VoIP handset, security camera, or wireless access point. PoE is defined in two IEEE standards (now both rolled into 802.3-2012):\n• 802.3af—powered devices can draw up to about 13 W over the link. Power is supplied as 350mA@48V and limited to 15.4 W, but the voltage drop over the maximum 100 feet of cable results in usable power of around 13 W.\n• 802.3at (PoE+)—powered devices can draw up to about 25 W. PoE+ allows for a broader range of devices to be powered such as cameras with pan/tilt/zoom capabilities, door controllers, and thin client computers.\n\nPoE-enabled switches are referred to as end-span (or end-point) Power Sourcing Equiptment If an existing switch does not support PoE, a device called a netbook. can be used. When a device is connected to a port on a PoE switch, the switch goes through a detection phase to determine whether the device is PoE-enabled. If not, it does not supply power over the port and therefore does not damage non-PoE devices. If so, it determines the device's power consumption and sets the supply voltage level appropriately.\n\nPowering these devices through a switch is more efficient than using a wall-socket AC adapter for each appliance. It also allows network management software to control the devices and apply power schemes, such as making unused devices go into sleep states and power capping.\ntag:C1 L5 TB

ETHERNET OVER POWER\nSOHO networks are unlikely to use a structured cabling scheme, with cable conduit and patch panels. Many SOHO networks will be based around a single Internet router, server computer, and several workstations, possibly all located within the same room. A residential network might also require connectivity for smart appliances, such as Smart TVs and game consoles. The main challenge is usually joining up the location selected for the majority of the equipment with the location of the Internet access line.\n\nAn obvious solution for connecting SOHO devices is wireless. For many SOHO networks, the bandwidth available for WLANs will be adequate. There may be interference issues, however, and some home appliances, such as set-top boxes, might not support Wi-Fi. As an alternative to installing new data cabling, Ethernet over Powerline products can make use of building power circuits. Power is typically delivered as a 50-60 Hz alternating current, at between 100-240 volts, varying from country to country. Powerline overlays a higher frequency carrier signal on the lines and uses this to transfer Ethernet frames.\n\n(https://4sorcero.s3.amazonaws.com/byteback/core_1/fig_core_1_261.png)\nPowerline adapter provides an Ethernet port from a power outlet. (Image by Le Moal Oliver © 123RF.com.)\n\nA network connection is established via a Powerline adapter plugged directly into an electrical outlet. Note that strip sockets are generally not supported. The adapter provides one or two Ethernet RJ-45 ports to connect network equipment. The adapters automatically detect and communicate with one another over the electrical wiring with no configuration needed, though optionally a security key can be enabled to encrypt transmissions. A pass-through adapter also features an electrical outlet, allowing continued use of the socket.\n\nStandards for Ethernet over Powerline are defined by IEEE 1901 and products are managed by the HomePlug Powerline Alliance. Most products on the market conform to the HomePlug AV or AV2 standards, which are interoperable (older HomePlug 1.0 devices are not compatible). Within this, products are rated according to the maximum (theoretical) bandwidth, from AV200 (200 Mbps) to AV1200. If a mix of adapters is used, the network will operate only at the highest speed supported by all of the adapters.\n\nNote: Most Powerline installations will not achieve more than half the theoretical bandwidth.\ntag:C1 L5 TB

Activity 5-2\nDiscussing Network Hardware Devices\n\nSCENARIO\nAnswer the following questions to check your understanding of the topic.\n\nQuestion 1. What is a MAC address?\n\nAnswer 1. A unique 48-bit identifier coded into every network interface. This is also referred to as the physical or hardware address. A MAC address is expressed as 12 hex digits, usually with colon or hyphen delimiters between each byte value. For example: aa:bb:cc:00:11:22. Each hex digit expresses a 4-bit value using the characters 0 to 9 plus A, B, C, D, E, and F.\n\nQuestion 2. What feature(s) should you check when ordering an Ethernet network card?\n\nAnswer 2. That it supports the correct speed (for example, Gigabit or 10GbE) and media type/connector (for example, RJ-45 for copper cabling or LC for fiber optic).\n\nQuestion 3. A technician has discovered an 8-port Ethernet hub appliance in a store. Can this device be usefully deployed on a modern network?\n\nAnswer 3. No. Hubs support only half duplex mode and limited speed. There could be very specific circumstances in which you need to deploy a hub (to support some sort of legacy server equipment, for instance) but in general terms, using a hub along with modern switches and network adapters is likely to cause configuration errors and performance problems.\n\nQuestion 4. Your manager is resisting the use of an unmanaged switch to support a network of up to a dozen computers at a branch office. What are the arguments for and against proceeding?\n\nAnswer 4. As it requires no configuration, an unmanaged switch should be simpler (and cheaper) to deploy. An unmanaged switch will not support configuration features such as Virtual LANs (VLANs), but these would not be required on such a small network. A managed switch would support a remote configuration and monitoring interface and security features that might be useful, however. You might also mention traffic prioritization as a good reason to deploy a managed switch (though the scenario does not specify supporting VoIP handsets).\n\nQuestion 5. You are assisting a customer looking to purchase switches that support powering VoIP handset devices directly. The customer is confused between Power over Ethernet and Ethernet over Power. Can you explain the difference and identify which technology the customer needs?\n\nAnswer 5. The customer needs a switch supporting Power over Ethernet (PoE). This means that the switch sends power over the data cabling and RJ-45 port to the device. Ethernet over Power (or Powerline) is a means of networking devices by using building power outlets and circuits, rather than data cabling.\ntag:C1 L5 TB A5-2

Topic C\nWireless Networks\n\nEXAM OBJECTIVES COVERED\n1001-2.2 Compare and contrast common networking hardware devices.\n1001-2.4 Compare and contrast wireless networking protocols.\n1001-2.7 Compare and contrast Internet connection types, network types, and their features.\n\nWireless technologies can now achieve sufficient bandwidth to replace wired ports for many types of clients in a typical office. It is also more convenient for SOHO networks to use wireless as the primary access method for computers, laptops, smartphones, and tablets. Wireless can provide connectivity for desktops or even servers in places where it is difficult or expensive to run network cabling. As a CompTIA A+ technician, you will often be called upon to install, configure, and troubleshoot wireless technologies, so it is imperative that you understand the basics.\ntag:C1 L5 TC

WHAT IS WIRELESS NETWORKING?\nWireless" encompasses a whole range of connectivity products and technologies, from personal area networking to Internet connectivity. Most wireless technologies use radio waves as transmission media. Radio systems use transmission and reception antennas tuned to a specific frequency for the transfer of signals.\ntag:C1 L5 TC

WIRELESS FREQUENCIES AND CHANNELS\nThe range of broadcast radio frequencies (RF) extends from 3 KHz to 300 GHz. Frequencies are subdivided into bands such as very low and ultra high. FM radio and television signals are broadcast in the Very High Frequency (VHF) band (30-300 MHz).\n\nThe use of the radio spectrum is regulated by national governments and (to some extent) standardized internationally by the International Telecommunications Union (ITU). Use of a frequency usually requires a license from the relevant government agency. The license ensures no one else can transmit that frequency within a particular area.\n\nThere are however, unregulated frequencies—Industrial, Scientific, and Medical (ISM) bands—that do not require a license, such as the 2.4 GHz and 5 GHz bands. The> wireless networking products operate in these unregulated ultra high frequencies.\n\nThere is a limit on power output, which means range is restricted.\n\n802.11 (WIRELESS LAN STANDARDS)\nWhen talking about "wireless networking" for desktops, laptops, smartphones, and tablets, the term is generally understood to mean the IEEE's 802.11 standards for Wireless LANs (WLANs), also called IEEE's 802.11. There are five main versions of the standard, as summarized here:\n\n(https://4sorcero.s3.amazonaws.com/byteback/core_1/table_core_1_264.png)\n(https://4sorcero.s3.amazonaws.com/byteback/core_1/table_core_1_265.png)\n\nStandard          Maximum Transfer Rate         Band\n802.11a (1999)            54 Mbps               5 GHz\n802.11b (1999)              11 Mbps            2.4 GHz\n802.11g (2003)             54 Mbps              2.4 GHz\n802.11n (2009)                                  2.4/5 GHz\n                     288.8 Mbps/stream (Single\n                          Channel)\n                      600 Mbps/stream (Bonded\n                             Channels)\n802.11ac (2013)            1.7 Gbps (at time of writing) 5 GHz\n\nNote that the transfer rates quoted are illustrative of an optimal installation and are heavily dependent on the quality of the access point, the number of clients connecting simultaneously, and interference and obstructions in the environment. The frequencies used by Wi-Fi lack penetrating power and there can be interference from nearby unregulated devices, such as baby monitors and cordless phones. Microwave ovens can also cause interference.\n\nThe actual data rate will drop with distance and in the presence of interference, with the preference being for a slower, stable connection over a faster, error-prone one.\n\nFREQUENCIES\nEvery wireless device operates on a specific radio frequency within an overall frequency band. It is important to understand the difference between the two most common frequency bands in the IEEE 802.11 standards: 2.4 GHz and 5.0 GHz.\n• 2.4 GHz is the longer wavelength, which gives it longer range (given the same power output) and makes it better at propagating through solid surfaces. However, the 2.4 GHz band does not support a high number of individual channels and is often congested, both with other Wi-Fi networks and other types of wireless technology, such as Bluetooth. Consequently, with the 2.4 GHz band there is increased risk of interference and the maximum achievable data rates are typically lower than with a 5 GHz channel.\n• 5 GHz is less effective at penetrating solid surfaces and so does not support the maximum ranges achieved with 2.4 GHz standards. Nonetheless, the band supports more individual channels and suffers less from congestion and interference, meaning it supports higher data rates.\n\nRANGE\nProducts working in the 2.4 GHz band can be quoted as having a maximum indoor range of anywhere from 30 to 45 m (100 - 150 feet). Products using 5 GHz are usually quoted as having a maximum range of about one third less (up to about 30 m, say). For most wireless networks, however, absolute range is less important than the number of clients that have to be supported and the construction of walls and ceilings.\n\nCHANNELS\nThe 2. band is subdivided into up to 14 channels, spaced at 5 MHz intervals from 2412 MHz up to 2484 MHz. Wi-Fi requires bandwidth of approximately 20 MHz, not 5 MHz. Consequently, a site designer needs to choose the channels that do not overlap. On a WLAN where only the first 11 channels are available, channels 1, 6, and 11 can be selected as non-overlapping.\n\nNote: In the Americas, regulations permit the use of channels 1-11 only, while in Europe, channels 1-13 are permitted. In Japan, all 14 channels are permitted.\n\nThe limited number of non-overlapping channels means that co-channel interference is a real possibility. Special codes embedded in the signal give each transmitting node a distinguishing pattern, so that nearby networks can share the same channel at once. At some point, however, the channel becomes saturated with too many WLANs.\n\nThe 5 GHz band is subdivided into 23 non-overlapping channels each ~20 MHz-wide. The greater number of non-overlapping channels means that co-channel interference is less of a problem for the 5 GHz band. This means that more WLANs can occupy the same area or that you can provision more access points closer together to support a greater density of client devices.\n\nNote: Initially there were 11 channels in the 5 GHz band, but the subsequent 802.11h standard added another 12. 802.11h also adds the Dynamic Frequency Selection (DFS) method to prevent access points working in the 5 GHz band from interfering with radar and satellite signals. The exact use of channels can be subject to different regulations in different countries.\ntag:C1 L5 TC

WIRELESS NETWORK STANDARDS\nUse of the legacy standards—802.11a/b/g—is now limited to quite old equipment. You are relatively unlikely to come across networks still supporting them. As 802.11nb and g both worked at 2.4 GHz, 802.11g provided an upgrade path for 802.11b WLANs. Working in the 5 GHz band, 802.11a is incompatible with the other two and was not as widely adopted.\n\nIEEE 802.11n\nThe 802.11n standard provides substantially more bandwidth than the legacy standards. It multiplexes the signals from 2-4 separate antennas in a process called Multiple-Input-Multiple-Output (MIMO). The configuration of 802.11n devices is identified by AxB:C notation, where A is the number of transmit antennas, B is the number of receive antennas, and C is the number of simultaneous transmit and receive streams. The maximum possible is 4x4:4 but common configurations are 2x2:2, 3x3:2, or 3x3:3. Both the transmitter and receiver must support the same number of streams.\n\n802.11n can deliver even more bandwidth with the option to use two adjacent 20 MHz channels as a single 40 MHz channel (channel bonding). 802.11n products can use channels in the 2.4 GHz band or the 5 GHz band. The 5 GHz band is preferred for optimal bandwidth and to avoid interference with existing 2.4 GHz networks and devices. Channel bonding is only a practical option in the 5 GHz band. Assuming the maximum number of spatial streams and optimum conditions, the nominal data rates for 802.11n are 288.8 Mbps for a single channel and 600 Mbps for bonded channels.\n\nNote: Cheaper adapters may only support the 2.4 GHz band. Many smartphone models only support 2.4 GHz. An access point or adapter that can support both is referred to as dual band. A dual band access point can support both 2.4 GHz and 5 GHz bands simultaneously. This allows legacy clients to be allocated to the 2.4 GHz band.\n\nIEEE 802.11ac\nThe 802.11ac standard continues the development of 802.11n technologies. The main distinction is that 802.11ac works only in the 5 GHz band. The 2.4 GHz band can be used for legacy standards (802.11b/g/n) in mixed mode. The aim for 802.11ac is to get throughput similar to that of Gigabit Ethernet or better. It supports more channel bonding (up to 80 or 160 MHz channels), up to 8 spatial streams rather than 4, and denser modulation (at close ranges).\n\nAs with 802.11n, only high-end equipment will be equipped with sufficient antennas to make use of up to 8 streams. At the time of writing, no devices actually support more than 4x4:4 streams. The maximum theoretical data rate with 8 streams and 160 MHz channel bonding is about 6.93 Gbps. Cisco's Aironet 1850e 4x4:4 access points support up to 1.7 Gbps with 80 MHz channels.\ntag:C1 L5 TC

ACCESS POINTS AND WIRELESS NETWORK MODES\nMost Wi-Fi networks are configured in what is technically referred to as infrastructure mode. Infrastructure mode means that each client device (or station) is configured to connect to the network via an Access Point (AP). In 802.11 documentation, this is referred to as a Basic Service Set (BSS). The MAC address of the AP is used as the Basic Service Set Identifier (BSSID). More than one BSS can be grouped together in an Extended Service Set (ESS).\n\nThe access point works as a bridge, forwarding communications between the wireless stations and the wired network, referred to as a Distribution System (DS). The access point will be joined to the network in much the same way as a host computer is—via a wall port and cabling to an Ethernet switch.\n\n(https://4sorcero.s3.amazonaws.com/byteback/core_1/fig_core_1_267.png)\nAn access point. (Image © 123RF.com.)\n\nAccess Points can also be configured to forward frames between one another, functioning in a Wireless Distribution System (WDS) to extend the network without using a cabled backbone. A WDS can be configured in bridge mode, where the access points only forward communications between one another, and repeater mode, where they also communicate with stations.\n\nA WDS can be complex to set up and can suffer from compatibility problems when devices from multiple vendors are used. For residential users, a  is a simpler device for regenerating a signal from an access point to a more remote location, such as an upstairs room. Another option is a range extender that works with a powerline adapter to communicate with the access point over the electrical wiring.\n\nAD-HOC AND WI-FI DIRECT\nStations can also be configured to connect directly to one another. With older network standards, this is referred to as ad-hoc mode . Such peer-to-peer connections are now more likely to be implemented as Wi-Fi Direct, which has the advantage of automatically configuring a secure link between the stations.\n\nWIRELESS MESH NETWORK (WMN) TOPOLOGY\nThe 802.11s standard defines a Wireless Mesh Network (WMN). Unlike an ad-hoc network, nodes in a WMN (called Mesh Stations) are capable of discovering one another and peering, forming a Mesh Basic Service Set (MBSS). The mesh stations can perform path discovery and forwarding between peers, using a routing protocol, such as the Hybrid Wireless Mesh Protocol (HWMP).\n\nPERSONAL AREA NETWORKS\nThe concept of a Personal Area Network (PAN) has gained some currency with the profusion of wireless and cellular connection technologies in the last few years. A PAN refers to using wireless connectivity to connect to devices within a few meters— printers, smartphones, headsets, speakers, video displays, and so on.\ntag:C1 L5 TC

WIRELESS NETWORK CARDS\nEach station in a Wi-Fi network needs to be installed with a Wi-Fi adapter supporting the 802.11 standard(s) used on the network. A Wi-Fi adapter can be installed if the function is not available on the motherboard. Both internally installed adapter cards and USB-connected adapters are available. A Wi-Fi card may also need to be installed to support the latest standard (upgrading from 802.11g to 802.11n or 802.11ac, for instance). Like an Ethernet card, a Wi-Fi adapter is identified at the data link layer by a MAC address.\ntag:C1 L5 TC

Activity 5-3\nDiscussing Wireless Networks\n\nSCENARIO\n\nQuestion 1. What is the maximum transfer rate of an 802.11g Wi-Fi adapter?\nAnswer 1. 54 Mbps.\n\nQuestion 2. Why are 2.4 GHz networks more susceptible to interference than 5 GHz networks?\n\nAnswer 2. Each channel in a 2.4 GHz network is only 5 MHz wide while Wi-Fi requires about 20 MHz. Consequently, there is not much "space" for separate networks and the chances of overlap are high. There are also numerous other product types that work in the 2.4 GHz band.\n\nQuestion 3. How does 802.11n achieve greater speeds than previous Wi-Fi standards?\n\nAnswer 3. Largely through using multiple reception and transmission antennas (MIMO) and channel bonding.\n\nQuestion 4. Can 802.11ac achieve higher throughput by multiplexing the signals from both 2.4 and 5 GHz frequency bands? Why or why not?\n\nAnswer 4. No, because 802.11ac works only at 5 GHz.\n\nQuestion 5. Why might a wireless mesh network topology be used?\n\nAnswer 5. Each station in a wireless mesh can be made capable of discovering other nodes on the network and forwarding traffic. This can be used to create a network that covers a wide area without deploying numerous access points or extenders.\ntag:C1 L5 TC A5-3

Topic D\nInternet Connection Types\n\nEXAM OBJECTIVES COVERED\n1001-2.2 Compare and contrast common networking hardware devices.\n1001-2.4 Compare and contrast wireless networking protocols.\n1001-2.7 Compare and contrast Internet connection types, network types, and their features.\n\nIn the previous topics, you identified the network cabling and devices used to implement different types of Local Area Networks (LANs). A key component of any network is the ability to communicate with remote hosts over the Internet. In this topic, you will learn to compare and contrasts methods of Internet access, as provided for typical SOHO network types.\ntag:C1 L5 TD

INTERNET CONNECTIONS\nThe major infrastructure of the Internet, also referred to as the Internet backbone, consists of very high bandwidth trunks connecting Internet eXchange Points (IXPs). These trunks and IXPs are mostly created by telecommunications companies and academic institutions. They are typically organized on national and international levels. Internet Service Providers (ISPs) Within the data center supporting any given IXP, establish high-speed links between their networks, using transit and peering arrangements to carry traffic to and from parts of the Internet they do not physically own. There is a tiered hierarchy of ISPs that reflects to what extent they depend on transit arrangements with other ISPs.\n\nCustomers connect to an ISP's network via a local Point of Presence (PoP). The ISP uses a backhaul link (or a transit arrangement with another ISP) to connect each POP to their core network infrastructure and one or more IXPs.\ntag:C1 L5 TD

INTERNET SERVICE PROVIDERS\nMost home users and businesses rely on an Internet Service Provider (ISP) to facilitate the link between their SOHO network and the Internet. Internet access is then a question of how you join your local network to the ISP's PoP. The consumer and small business technologies for doing this are dial-up, "broadband" (DSL, FTTx, or cable), and wireless (radio or satellite). Each has its advantages and\ndisadvantages depending on the type of access and frequency of use required.\n\nMost SOHO Internet access methods makes use of the Network (PSTN) Public Switched Telephone. The PSTN is the national and global telecommunications network. The voice-grade copper wire part of this network (between subscribers and the telecom provider's switches) is sometimes referred to as the Service Plain Old Telephone(POTS) local loop," or "last mile."\n\nThe ISP handles the business of allocating one or more public Internet Protocol (IP) addresses that will work on the Internet and other services, such as domain name registration, web and email hosting, and so on. Enterprise ISP solutions will offer much higher bandwidth links, often using fiber optic cabling.\n\n(https://4sorcero.s3.amazonaws.com/byteback/core_1/fig_core_1_271.png)\nInternet access for a standalone PC via an ISP. (Image © 123RF.com.)\n\nPOINT-TO-POINT PROTOCOL\nThe Point-to-Point Protocol (PPP) is typically used to encapsulate the network protocol, which will usually be TCP/IP, over the link to the ISP. PPP also provides a mechanism to authenticate the user and manage the connection between the local computer or network and the ISP's router.\ntag:C1 L5 TD

BROADBAND INTERNET ACCESS\nBroadband covers a range of different connection technologies. The main characteristics are that they are "always-on" (that is, the connection does not need to be re-established for each session) and data transfer rates are (a lot) higher than analog dial-up.\ntag:C1 L5 TD

DSL\nDigital Subscriber Line (DSL) uses the higher frequencies available in a copper telephone line as a communications channel. The use of a filter prevents the DSL signals from contaminating voice traffic. The use of advanced modulation and echo cancelling techniques enable high bandwidth, full duplex transmissions.\n\nA DSL "modem" makes the connection to the phone system. Typically, the modem function will be part of a DSL router/modem/access point appliance that can provide access to a small network of computers. The phone line makes the connection to a bank of DSL modems in the exchange, called a DSL Access Multiplier (DSLAM). The DSLAM channels voice and data traffic to the appropriate network. Depending on the equipment used by the ISP, the data link protocol used for DSL may be PPP over ATM (PPPoA) or PPP over Ethernet (PPPoE).\n\nThere are various "flavors" of DSL, notably asymmetrical and symmetrical types:\n• Asymmetrical DSL (ADSL) is a "consumer" version of DSL that provides a fast downlink but a slow uplink. There are various iterations of ADSL, with the latest (ADSL2+) offering downlink rates up to about 24 Mbps and uplink rates up to 1.4 Mbps, or 3.3 Mbps upstream if the provider supports Annex M/ADSL2+ M.\n\nOften service providers impose usage restrictions to limit the amount of data downloaded per month. Actual speed may be affected by the quality of the cabling in the consumer's premises and between the premises and the exchange and also by the number of users connected to the same DSLAM (contention). The maximum range of an ADSL modem is typically about 10,000 feet (2 miles or 3 km), but the longer the connection, the greater the deterioration in data rate.\n\n• Symmetric versions of DSL offer the same uplink and downlink speeds. These are of more use to businesses and for branch office links, where more data is transferred upstream than with normal Internet use.\n\n• Very High Bitrate DSL (VDSL) achieves higher bit rates at the expense of range. It allows for both symmetric and asymmetric modes. Over 300 m (1000 feet), an asymmetric link supports 52 Mbps downstream and 6 Mbps upstream, whereas a symmetric link supports 26 Mbps in both directions. VDSL2 also specifies a very short range (100 m/300 feet) rate of 100 Mbps (bi-directional).\ntag:C1 L5 TD

FIBER OPTIC INTERNET ACCESS\nFiber optic cabling supports much higher bandwidth and lower distance limitations than copper cabling. Fiber optic cabling has replaced copper cabling within the "core" of telecommunications networks. Extending fiber optic cabling to individual subscriber homes and businesses is slowly taking place. There are two principal types of businesses operating fiber optic networks for SOHO Internet access—companies with their roots in cable TV on one hand and the telecommunications providers with their roots in telephone services on the other.\n\nHYBRID FIBER COAX (HFC)/CABLE\nA cable Internet connection is usually available along with a Cable Access TV (CATV)  service. These networks are often described as Hybrid Fiber Coax (HFC) as they combine a fiber optic core network with coax links to customer premises equipment, but are more simply just described as "broadband cable" or just as "cable."\n\nThe cable modem is interfaced to the local network or computer through an Ethernet adapter and with the cable network by a short segment of coax. More coax then links all the premises in a street with a Cable Modem Termination System (CMTS) , which routes data traffic via the fiber backbone to the ISP's Point of Presence (PoP) and from there to the Internet. Cable based on the Specification Data Over Cable Service Interface(DOCSIS) supports downlink speeds of up to 38 Mbps (North America) or 50 Mbps (Europe) and uplinks of up to 27 Mbps. DOCSIS version 3 allows the use of multiplexed channels to achieve higher bandwidth.\n\nFIBER TO THE CURB (FTTC)\nFor the telecommunications companies, the major obstacle to providing really high bandwidth to consumers and small businesses is in the last mile of the telephone network. Copper cabling infrastructure in the last mile is often of poor quality as it was only designed to service a telephone line. The projects to update this wiring to use fiber optic links are referred to by the umbrella term "Fiber to the X" (FTTx).\n\nThe most expensive solution is  Fiber to the Premises (FTTP) or its domestic variant Fiber to the Home (FTTH). The essential point about both these implementations is that the fiber link is terminated on customer premises equipment. Such "pure" fiber solutions are not widespread and generally carry a price premium above other types of Internet access.\n\nOther solutions can variously be described as Fiber to the Node (FTTN) or Fiber to the Curb/Cabinet (FTTC).  These extend the fiber link to a communications cabinet in the street servicing multiple subscribers. This is similar model to HFC, but instead of the coax segment, each subscriber is linked to the fiber service by running Very High Bitrate DSL (VDSL) over the existing telephone wiring.\ntag:C1 L5 TD

DIAL-UP INTERNET ACCESS\nDial-up is simply a telephone conversation between two computers. Whereas with DSL this "conversation" is pushed to the higher frequency parts of the phone line, with dial-be prevalent in rural up it occupies the whole frequency range, but not very efficiently. Ordinary telephone charges apply for the duration of each session and the phone line cannot be used for voice calls at the same time. A dial-up link is very low bandwidth.\n\nA dial-up connection is facilitated by analog modems on each end of the line. A dial-up modem converts digital signals to an analog carrier signal (modulation) and transmits it over the telephone cable, making a distinctive screeching noise. The modem at the other end converts the analog signal back to digital (demodulation) and processes the data.\n\n(https://4sorcero.s3.amazonaws.com/byteback/core_1/fig_core_1_273.png)\nDial-up modems. (Image © 123RF.com.)\n\nThe main disadvantages of this system are the low data transfer rates, the time it takes for the connection to be established, and error prone links. The fastest modems can only usually work at 33.6 Kbps (V.34+) and this speed is reaching the limitations of analog lines. Using the V.90 or V.92 digital signaling protocol, a downlink speed of up to 56 Kbps is possible in theory, though rarely achieved in practice. The use of compression can also improve the data transfer throughput, though as many of the files being transferred are likely to be compressed already (image files, for instance), the improvement will be variable.\n\nConsequently, dial-up has been almost completely superseded by other technologies and would only be used as a backup method or in areas where no other access methods are supported.\ntag:C1 L5 TD

ISDN INTERNET ACCESS\nIntegrated Services Digital Network (ISDN) is a digital circuit-switched technology for voice, video, and data (hence "integrated services"). ISDN makes use of existing copper telephone wiring, if the wiring is of sufficient quality. Unlike dial-up, however, it uses the line to transmit digital signatures for both voice and data. This means that there are no inefficient analog-to-digital conversions and so higher speeds can be supported.\n\nISDN is a dial-up service billed for by line rental and per-minute usage. Although it is a dial-up technology, it is capable of establishing a circuit connection in less than 1 second—much faster than an analog modem. The most common uses of ISDN are for interconnection of LANs and remote users (teleworkers) to businesses. There are two classes of ISDN:\n• Basic Rate Interface (BRI) provides two 64 Kbps "B" channels for data and one 16 Kbps "D" channel for link management control signals. It is sometimes called 2B+D. One option is to use one B channel for data and leave the other for voice or fax; another is to provide a 128 Kbps link by concatenating the two B channels. This form of ISDN is intended for SOHO use.\n• Primary Rate Interface (PRI) provides 23 or 30 "B" channels (or between about 1.5 and 2 Mbps), depending on location in the world, and one 64 Kbps D channel. This form of ISDN is intended for larger companies and is commonly used to provide a link between two company locations.\n\nMuch of the switching technology of ISDN remains in use in terms of the telecommunications core network, but as an Internet access method for subscribers, it has largely been superseded by DSL and cable. It remains a good solution outside metropolitan areas where these other services may not be available.\n\nAn ISDN connection would typically be facilitated through a Terminal Adapter (TA). The TA may be an external appliance or a plug-in card for a PC or compatible router. The TA is connected to the ISDN network via an NT1 device (Network Terminator). The ISDN-enabled router may then either be connected to a switch or support direct connections from ISDN devices.\ntag:C1 L5 TD

FIXED WIRELESS INTERNET ACCESS\nWired broadband Internet access is not always available, especially in rural areas or in older building developments, where running new cable capable of supporting DSL or FTTC is problematic. In this scenario, some sort of fixed wireless Internet access might be an option\n\nSATELLITE INTERNET ACCESS\nSatellite systems provide far bigger areas of coverage than can be achieved using other Very Small Aperture Terminal (VSAT) technologies. A   microwave antenna is aligned to an orbital satellite that can either relay signals between sites directly or via another satellite. Satellites use frequency bands in the Super High Frequency range (3-30 GHz). The widespread use of satellite television receivers allows for domestic Internet connectivity services over satellite connections. Satellite services for business are also expanding, especially in rural areas where DSL or cable services are less likely to be available. The transfer rates available vary between providers and access packages, but 2 or 6 Mbps up and 15-20 Mbps down would be typical. There are also likely to be quite restrictive usage limits.\n\nSatellite connections experience quite severe latency problems as the signal has to travel over thousands of miles more than terrestrial connections, introducing a delay of many times what might be expected over a land link. For example, if accessing a site over DSL involves a 15-50 ms delay on the link, accessing the same site over a satellite link could involve a 1000 ms delay. This is an issue for real-time applications, such as video-conferencing, VoIP, and multi-player gaming.\n\nTo create a satellite Internet connection, the ISP installs a satellite dish (antenna) at the customer's premises and aligns it with the orbital satellite. The satellites are in geostationary orbit above the equator, so in the northern hemisphere the dish will be pointing south. Because the satellite does not move relative to the dish, there should be no need for any realignment. The antenna is connected via coaxial cabling to a DVB-S (Digital Video Broadcast Satellite) modem. This can be installed in the PC as an adapter card or as an external box connected via a USB or Ethernet port.\n\nLINE OF SIGHT WIRELESS INTERNET SERVICE PROVIDER (WISP)\nLine of Sight (LoS) is a wireless connection method using ground-based microwave antennas aligned with one another. Endpoints can transmit signals to one another as long as they are unobstructed by physical objects. The antennas themselves are typically affixed to the top of tall buildings in order to reduce this interference. A line of sight service can cover great distances that typical wireless signals cannot, while at the same time saving the service provider from having to install cabling infrastructure. Additionally, the connection in an LoS service is often low latency, or at least, lower latency than satellite.\n\nA disadvantage of LoS is that the actual unobstructed sight line can be difficult to maintain, especially if the area between the two endpoints is not owned by the client or the provider. Likewise, LoS services are usually more expensive than other methods.\n\nA company specializing in LoS networks is referred to as a Wireless Internet Service Provider (WISP). WISP might use Wi-Fi type networking or proprietary equipment. The services can operate over a range of frequencies. The use of certain frequencies may be impacted by the deployment of 5G cellular services, which may involve changes to the way some frequency bands are licensed for use.\ntag:C1 L5 TD

CELLULAR RADIO NETWORKS\nThe 2.4 GHz and 5 GHz frequency bands used by Wi-Fi have quite severely restricted range while fixed wireless Internet requires a large dish antenna. Cellular radio wireless networking facilitates communications over much larger distances using portable equipment like smartphones. Cellular networking is also used by some Internet of Things (IoT) devices, such as smart energy meters.\n\nCELLULAR RADIO (GSM/TDMA AND CDMA)\nA cellular radio makes a connection using the nearest available transmitter (cell or base station). Each base station has an effective range of up to 5 miles (8 km). The transmitter connects the phone to the mobile and landline telephone networks. Transmitter coverage in many countries is now very good, with the exception of remote rural areas. Cellular radio works in the 850 and 1900 MHz frequency bands (mostly in the Americas) and the 900 and 1800 MHz bands (rest of the world).\n\nCellular digital communications standards are described as belonging to a particular generation. For 2G, there were two competing formats, established in different markets:\n• Global System for Mobile Communication (GSM)-based phones. GSM allow subscribers to use a Subscriber Identity Module (SIM) card to use an unlocked handset with their chosen network provider. GSM is adopted internationally and by AT&T and T-Mobile in the US.\n• TIA/EIA IS-95 (cdmaOne)-based handsets. With Code Division Multiple Access(CDMA), the handset is managed by the  provider, not the SIM. CDMA adoption is largely restricted to the telecom providers Sprint  and Verizon.\n\nIn both cases, the cell network was built primarily to support voice calls, so 2G data access was provided on top, using Circuit Switched Data (CSD). CSD is somewhat similar to a dial-up modem, though no analog transmissions are involved. CSD requires a data connection to be established to the base station (incurring call charges) and is only capable of around 14.4 Kbps at best.\n\n3G\nThe transition from 2G to 3G saw various packet-switched technologies deployed to mobiles:\n• General Packet Radio Services/Enhanced Data Rates for GSM Evolution (GPRS/ EDGE) is a precursor to 3G (2.5G) with GPRS offering up to about 48 Kbps and EDGE about 3-4 times that. Unlike CSD, GPRS and EDGE allow "always on" data connections, with usage billed by bandwidth consumption rather than connection time.\n• Evolved High Speed Packet Access (HSPA+) is a 3G standard developed via several iterations from the Universal Mobile Telecommunications System (UMTS) used on GSM networks. HSPA+ nominally supports download speeds up to 168 Mbps and upload speeds up to 34 Mbps. HSPA+-based services are often marketed as 4G if the nominal data rate is better than about 20 Mbps.\n• CDMA2000/Evolution Data Optimized (EV-DO) are the main 3G standards deployed by CDMA network providers. EV-DO can support a 3.1 Mbps downlink and 1.8 Mbps uplink.\n\n4G\nLong Term Evolution (LTE)is a converged 4G standard supported by all network providers. Any device using a 4G connection needs a SIM card. LTE has a maximum downlink of 150 Mbps in theory, but no provider networks can deliver that sort of speed at the time of writing. Around 20 Mbps is more typical of real-word performance.\n\nLTE Advanced (LTE-A) is intended to provide a 300 Mbps downlink, but again this aspiration is not matched by real-world performance. Current typical performance for LTE-A is around 40 Mbps.\n\n5G\nAccording to the original specification, a 4G service was supposed to deliver 1 Gbps for stationary or slow-moving users (including pedestrians) and 100 Mbps for access from a fast-moving vehicle. Those data rates are now the minimum hoped-for standards for 5G. 5G is currently only available in trial areas. Speeds of up to 70 Gbps have been achieved under test conditions, but commercial products and service standards are not likely to appear until 2020.\ntag:C1 L5 TD

Activity 5-4\nDiscussing Internet Connection Types\n\nSCENARIO\nAnswer the following questions to check your understanding of the topic.\n\nQuestion 1. If you have remote employees who need to connect to the corporate network but they are located in a remote area with no access to high-speed Internet service, what do you think is the best Internet connection method to use?\n\nAnswer 1. Satellite is the most likely option. A dial-up link is unlikely to provide sufficient bandwidth for a remote access VPN. In some cases, tethering to a cell phone or connecting to a wireless network device is an option, but this will depend on how remote the employees' location is and if they can get a strong cellular signal.\n\nQuestion 2. True or false? Analog modems are required for dial-up and ISDN Internet access services.\n\nAnswer 2. False. Dial-up uses an analog modem but Integrated Services Digital Network (ISDN) uses digital not analog transmissions. The link is created via an adapter called an NT1. This may loosely be referred to as an "ISDN modem," but it is not an analog modem.\n\nQuestion 3. What type of SOHO Internet access method offers the best bandwidth?\n\nAnswer 3. Fiber to the Premises is the best, but it is not always available. Fiber to the Curb and Hybrid Fiber Coax (cable) are the best options for the majority of residential subscribers.\n\nQuestion 4. Which protocol enables a dial-up user to exchange frames of data with an ISP's access server?\n\nAnswer 4. Point-to-Point Protocol (PPP).\n\nQuestion 5. What type of cabling is used with the WAN port of a cable modem?\n\nAnswer 5. Coax.\n\nQuestion 6. What Internet access method would be suitable for a business requiring a high bandwidth connection where no cabled options exist?\n\nAnswer 6. Line-of-sight microwave radio from a Wireless Internet Service Provider (WISP).\ntag:C1 L5 TD A-4

Topic E\nNetwork Configuration Concepts\n\nEXAM OBJECTIVES COVERED\n1001-2.2 Compare and contrast common networking hardware devices.\n1001-2.6 Explain common network configuration concepts.\n\nNow that you are familiar with the basic components that make up a network, you can start to take a look at Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol (TCP/IP) addressing and data delivery. In this topic, you will identify the properties and characteristics of TCP/IP.\n\nAs a CompTIA A+ technician, you must be able to identify how protocols work together allocate plenty of time. and with the network hardware to provide services. Understanding how everything is connected and functioning within the network will allow you to properly support TCP/IP within a network.\ntag:C1 L5 TE

ROUTERS\nEthernet switches connect nodes on the basis of local or hardware (MAC) addresses. Everything connected to an unmanaged switch is part of the same physical and logical network. When you want to connect such a network to the Internet or when you want to divide a large local network into logical subnetworks, you need to use one or more routers.\n\nA router is responsible for moving data around a network of networks, known as an internetwork or internet. While a switch forwards frames using hardware (MAC) addresses within a single network segment, a router forwards packets around an internetwork using logical network and host IDs.\n\n(https://4sorcero.s3.amazonaws.com/byteback/core_1/fig_core_1_278.png)\nA router. (Image © 123RF.com.)\n\nThere are many different types and uses of routers, but on an enterprise network, a router tends to perform one of the following two tasks:\n• LAN router—divide a single physical network into multiple logical networks. This is useful for security and performance reasons.\n• WAN or edge/border router—join a network using one type of media with a network using different media. A typical example is to join a LAN to a WAN, such as the Internet.\n\nSelection of the path or route to the destination network is determined dynamically or statically. The packet moves, hop by hop, through the internetwork to the target network. Once it has reached the destination network, the hardware address can be used to move the packet to the target node. This process requires each logically separate network to have a unique network address.\n\nROUTERS VERSUS MODEMS\nMake sure you understand the separate functions of modems and routers when connecting to the Internet. A router works at the same level as a switch, making a physical network link with the ISP's network. The type of modem must be matched to the type of link (dial-up, DSL, cable, and so on). A router makes decisions about forwarding between the two logical networks. For SOHO networks, this is usually a simple choice between the local network and the Internet. On a SOHO network, the modem and the router are typically bundled in the same appliance.\n\nVIRTUAL LAN (VLAN)\nThe switches on an enterprise network can provide thousands of ports. It is inefficient to have that many connections to the same "logical" network. The ports are divided into groups using a feature of managed switches called Virtual LAN (VLAN). Each VLAN is associated with a different logical subnetwork address. Communications between different VLANs therefore have to go through a router. As well as improving performance, this is a security benefit too. Traffic passing between VLANs can be easily filtered and monitored to ensure it meets security policies.\ntag:C1 L5 TE

THE TCP/IP PROTOCOL SUITE\nProtocols are procedures or rules used by networked hosts to communicate. For communication to take place, the two hosts must have a protocol in common. Often, several protocols used for networking are designed to work together. This collection of protocols is known as a protocol suite.\n\nA number of protocol suites have been used for LAN and WAN communications over the years. However, the overwhelming majority of networks have now converged on the use of the Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol (TCP/IP) suite. Most network implementations you will be required to install and support will depend on the use of TCP/IP.\n\nTCP/IP was originally developed by the US Department of Defense but is now an open standard to which anyone may contribute. Developments are implemented through the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF), which is split into a number of working groups. Standards are published as Request For Comments (RFCs). The official repository for RFCs is at www.rfc-editor.org and they are also published in HTML format at tools.ietf.org/html.\n\nTCP/IP protocols are packet-based. This means that rather than sending a data message as a single large whole, it is split into numerous small packets. Smaller packets have a better chance of being delivered successfully and are easier to resend if lost or damaged.\n\nRouters choose the paths that packets take around the network from source to destination.\n\nTCP/IP PROTOCOLS\nThe main protocols in the suite provide addressing and transport services. The function of these protocols can be better understood by dividing them into layers. The TCP/IP suite uses a model with four distinct layers.\n\n(https://4sorcero.s3.amazonaws.com/byteback/core_1/fig_core_1_280.png)\nTCP/IP model. (Image © 123RF.com.)\n\nThe layers and main protocols working at each layer are as follows:\n• Link or Network Interface layer—responsible for putting frames onto the physical network. This layer does not contain TCP/IP protocols as such. At this layer, different networking products and media can be used, such as Ethernet or Wi-Fi. Communications on this layer take place only on a local network segment and not between different networks. Data at the link layer is packaged in a unit called a frame and nodes are identified by a MAC address (assuming Ethernet or Wi-Fi).\n• Internet Protocol (IP)—provides packet addressing and routing at the network layer. IP provides best effort delivery of an unreliable and connectionless nature. A packet might be lost, delivered out of sequence, duplicated, or delayed.\n• Transmission Control Protocol (TCP)—guarantees orderly transmission of packets at the transport layer. TCP can identify and recover from lost or out-of-order packets. This is used by most TCP/IP application protocols as failing to receive a packet or processing it incorrectly can cause serious data errors.\n• User Datagram Protocol (UDP)—provides unreliable, non-guaranteed transfer of packets. UDP is an alternative way of implementing the transport layer to TCP. UDP is faster and comes with less of a transmission overhead because it does not need to send extra information to establish reliable connections. It is used in time-sensitive applications, such as speech or video, where a few missing or out-of-order packets can be tolerated. Rather than causing the application to crash, they would just manifest as a glitch in video or a squeak in audio.\n• Application protocols—there are numerous protocols used for network\nconfiguration, management, and services. Application protocols use a TCP or UDP\nport to connect the client and server.\n\nADDRESS RESOLUTION PROTOCOL (ARP)\nWhen IP is being used with a physical/data link specification such as Ethernet or Wi-Fi, there must be a mechanism to deliver messages from IP at the network layer to computers addressed at the link layer. Address Resolution Protocol (ARP) finds the MAC (network adapter) address associated with an IP address.\n\nICMP\nAdditionally, you should be aware of the Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMP), which works at the network layer. ICMP delivers status and error messages and is used by diagnostic utilities such as ping and tracert.\ntag:C1 L5 TE

INTERNET PROTOCOL AND IP ADDRESSING\nThe core protocol in TCP/IP is the Internet Protocol (IP), which provides network and host addressing and packet forwarding between networks.\n\nIPv4 PACKET STRUCTURE\nAs with a frame, an IP packet adds some headers to whatever transport/application layer data it is carrying in its payload. There are two versions of IP: IPv4 and IPv6. We will discuss IPv6 later. The main IPv4 headers are as follows:\n\n(https://4sorcero.s3.amazonaws.com/byteback/core_1/table_core_1_281.png)\n\nField                     Description\nSource IP address     Identifies the sender of the datagram by IP address.\nDestination IP address        Identifies the destination of the datagram by IP address.\nProtocol              Indicates whether the data should be passed to UDP or TCP at the destination host.\nChecksum              Verifies the packet's integrity upon arrival at the destination.\nTime to Live          The number of hops a datagram is allowed to stay on the network before being discarded, otherwise packets could endlessly loop around an internet. A router will decrease the TTL by at least one when it handles the packet.\n\nIPv4 ADDRESS FORMAT\nAn IPv4 address is 32 bits long and is used within an IPv4 packet to define the source and destination of the packet. In its raw form it appears as:\n\n11000110001010010001000000001001\n\nThe 32 bits are subdivided into four groups of 8 bits (1 byte) known as octets. The above IP address could therefore be rearranged as:\n\n11000110  00101001  00010000  00001001\n\nThis representation of an IP address makes human memorizing of the number almost impossible (much less entering it correctly into configuration dialogs). To make IP addresses easier to use, they are usually displayed in dotted decimal notation. This notation requires each octet to be converted to a decimal value. The decimal numbers are separated using a period. Converting the previous number to this notation gives:\n\n198 . 41 . 16 . 9\n\nCONVERTING BETWEEN BINARY AND DECIMAL FORMAT\nThe following examples demonstrate the process of converting between binary and decimal notation. The base of any number system tells us two things: how many different values any given digit can have and the factor by which the value of a digit increases as we move from right to left in a number. Thus, in normal base 10 (or decimal) numbers, a digit can take any one of ten different values (0 through 9), and the values of the different place positions within a number, moving from right to left, are units (ones), tens, hundreds, thousands, and so on.\n\nIn base 2 (binary), digits can only take one of two different values (0 and 1). The place values are powers of 2 (2^1=2, 2^2=4, 2^3=8, 2^4=16, and so on). Consider the octet 11101101" represented in base 2. The following figure shows the place value of each digit in the octet:\n\n128     64     32     16     8     4     2     1\n1      1      1      0     1     1     0     1\n128*1   64*1   32*1   16*0   8*1   4*1   2*0   1*1\n\nTherefore, the decimal equivalent is:\n\n128  +  64  +  32  +   0  +  8  +  4  +  0  +  1  = 237\n\nYou can use the same sort of method to convert from decimal to binary. For example, the number 199 can be converted as follows:\n\n199 =\n128  +  64  +   0  +   0  +  0  +  4  +  2  +  1\n128     64     32     16     8     4     2     1\n128*1   64*1   32*0   16*0   8*0   4*1   2*1   1*1\n1      1      0      0     0     1     1     1\n\nIf all the bits in an octet are set to 1, the number obtained is 255 (the maximum possible value). Similarly, if all the bits are set to 0, the number obtained is 0 (the minimum possible value). Therefore, theoretically an IPv4 address may be any value between 0.0.0.0 and 255.255.255.255. However, some addresses are not permitted or are reserved for special use.\ntag:C1 L5 TE

SUBNET MASKS\nAn IP address provides two pieces of information encoded within the same value:\n• The network number (network ID )—this number is common to all hosts on the same IP network.\n• The host number (host ID )—this unique number identifies a host on a particular IP network.\nA  subnet mask (or netmask) is used to distinguish these two components within a single IP address. It is used to "mask" the host ID portion of the IP address and thereby reveal the network ID portion.\n\nWhere there is a binary 1 in the mask, the corresponding binary digit in the IP address is part of the network ID. The relative sizes of the network and host portions determines the number of networks and hosts per network a particular addressing scheme can support.\n\nMany subnetting schemes use one of the  . These are masks comprising whole octets only. Each default mask is known by a particular "class."\n\n(https://4sorcero.s3.amazonaws.com/byteback/core_1/table_core_1_282.png)\n(https://4sorcero.s3.amazonaws.com/byteback/core_1/table_core_1_283.png)\n\nClass Mask Prefix Binary Mask\nA 255.0.0.0 /8 11111111 00000000 00000000 00000000\nB 255.255.0.0 /16 11111111 11111111 00000000 00000000\n\nDotted Decimal Network\nClass Mask Prefix Binary Mask\nC 255.255.255.0 /24 11111111 11111111 11111111 00000000\n\nThe mask can be expressed in dotted decimal format or as a network prefix. The network prefix is simply the number of ones that appear in the mask.\n\nNote: The 1s in the mask are always contiguous. For example, a mask 11111111 11110000 00000000 00000000 is valid but 11111111 00000000 11110000 00000000 is not.\n\nMASKING AN IP ADDRESS (ANDing)\nThe network ID portion of an IP address is revealed by "ANDing" the subnet mask to the IP address. When two 1s are ANDed together, the result is a 1. Any other combination produces a 0.\n\n1   AND   1   =   1\n1   AND   0   =   0\n0   AND   1   =   0\n0   AND   0   =   0\n\nFor example, to determine the network ID of the IP address 172.30.15.12 with a subnet mask of 255.255.0.0, the dotted decimal notation of the IP address and subnet mask must first be converted to binary notation. The next step is to AND the two binary numbers. The result can be converted back to dotted decimal notation to provide the network ID (172.30.0.0).\n\n172. 30. 15. 12   10101100 00011110 00001111 00001100\n255.255.  0.  0   11111111 11111111 00000000 00000000\n172. 30.  0.  0   10101100 00011110 00000000 00000000\n\nInstead of quoting the mask each time, you could express that network ID with a prefix instead: 172.30.0.0/16 .\n\nROUTING DECISION\nA host can communicate directly on the local network segment with any other host that has the same network ID. Communications with a host that has a different network ID must be sent via a router.\n\nWhen two hosts attempt to communicate via IPv4, the protocol compares the source and destination address in each packet against a subnet mask. If the masked portions of the source and destination IP addresses match, then the destination interface is assumed to be on the same IP network. For example:\n172. 30. 15. 12   10101100 00011110 00001111 00001100\n255.255.  0.  0   11111111 11111111 00000000 00000000\n172. 30. 16.101   10101100 00011110 00010000 01100101\n\nIn the example, IP concludes the destination IPv4 address is on the same IP network and would try to deliver the packet locally.\n\nIf the masked portion does not match, IP assumes the packet must be routed to another IP network. For example:\n172. 30. 15. 12   10101100 00011110 00001111 00001100\n255.255.  0.  0   11111111 11111111 00000000 00000000\n172. 31. 16.101   10101100 00011111 00010000 01100101\n\nIn this case, IP concludes the destination IPv4 address is on a different IP network and would forward the packet to a router rather than trying to deliver it locally.\n\nNote: This describes unicast addressing, where a single host is addressed. An address where the host bits are all "1"s is the broadcast address for a network. A message sent to a broadcast address is received by all hosts on the network. The broadcast address of the previous example would be 172.16.255.255.\ntag:C1 L5 TE

HOST IP CONFIGURATION\nEach host must be configured with an IP address and subnet mask at a minimum in order to communicate on an IPv4 network. This minimum configuration will not prove very usable, however. Several other parameters must be configured for a host to make full use of a modern network or the Internet.\n\nIPv4 ADDRESS AND SUBNET MASK\nAn IPv4 address and subnet mask can be set manually (static address). The IP address is entered as four decimal numbers separated by periods (e.g., 172.30.15.12). The IP address identifies both the network to which the interface is attached and also its unique identity on that network. An interface must be configured with an IP address.\n\nThe subnet mask is used in conjunction with the IP address to determine whether another interface is located on a local or remote network. An interface must be configured with a subnet mask.\n\nDEFAULT GATEWAY\nThe default gateway parameter is the IP address of a router to which packets destined for a remote network should be sent by default. This setting is not compulsory but failure to enter a gateway would limit the interface to communication on the local network only.\n\nCLIENT-SIDE DNS\nAnother important part of IP configuration is specifying the IP address of one or more Domain Name System (DNS)servers. These servers provide resolution of host and domain names to their IP addresses and are essential for locating resources on the Internet. Most local networks also use DNS for name resolution. Typically, the DNS server would be the gateway address, though this may not be the case on all networks. Often two DNS server addresses (preferred and alternate) are specified for redundancy.\ntag:C1 L5 TE

STATIC AND DYNAMIC IP ADDRESSES\nUsing static addressing requires that an administrator visit each computer to manually enter the configuration information for that host. If the host moves to a different subnet, the administrator must manually reconfigure it. The administrator must keep track of which IP addresses have been allocated to avoid issuing duplicates. In a large network, configuring IP statically on each node can be very time consuming and prone to errors that can potentially disrupt communication on the network. Static addresses are typically only assigned to systems with a dedicated functionality, such as router interfaces, network-attached printers, or servers that host applications on a network.\n\nDHCP\nWhen an interface is given a static configuration manually, the installer may make a mistake with the address information—perhaps duplicating an existing IP address or entering the wrong subnet mask—or the configuration of the network may change, requiring the host to be manually configured with a new static address. To avoid these problems, a Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) Server can be used to allocate an IP address and subnet mask (plus other settings) dynamically. The computer contacts the DHCP server as it starts up and is allocated a lease for an IP address. Settings such as default gateway and DNS server addresses may be passed to the computer at the same time. If the address information needs to change, this can be done on the DHCP server, and clients will update themselves automatically when they seek a new lease (or a new lease can be requested manually).\n\nNote: The DHCP client communicates with the server using broadcast communications so there is no need to configure a DHCP server address.\n\n(https://4sorcero.s3.amazonaws.com/byteback/core_1/fig_core_1_285.png)\nDHCP. (Image © 123RF.com.)\n\nLINK LOCAL ADDRESSING/APIPA\nHosts also have a "fallback" mechanism for when the computer is configured to use a DHCP server but cannot contact one. In this scenario, the computer selects an address at random from the range 169.254.1.0 to 169.254.254.255. Microsoft calls this Automatic Private IP Addressing (APIPA). When a host is using an APIPA address, it can communicate with other hosts on the same network that are using APIPA, but cannot reach other networks or communicate with hosts that have managed to obtain a valid DHCP lease.\n\nNote: "APIPA" is Microsoft\'s term. Other vendors and open source products use the term link local" instead.\n\nDHCP RESERVATIONS\nIt is often useful for a host to use the same IP address. Servers, routers, printers, and other network infrastructure can be easier to manage if their IP addresses are known. One option is to use static addressing for these appliances, but this is difficult to implement. Another option is to configure the DHCP server to   a particular IP address for that device. The DHCP server is configured with a list of the MAC addresses of hosts that should receive the same IP address. When it is contacted by a host with one of the listed MAC addresses, it issues a lease for the reserved IP address.\n\nNote: The main drawback of this method is that if the DHCP server fails, then critical network devices might fail to obtain IP addresses.\ntag:C1 L5 TE

PUBLIC AND PRIVATE IP ADDRESSES\nTo communicate on the Internet, a host must obtain a unique public IP address. Typically this is allocated by an Internet Service Provider. Relatively few companies can obtain sufficient public IP addresses for all their computers to communicate over the Internet, however. There are various mechanisms to work around this issue.\n\nPRIVATE ADDRESSING\nThe IP address scheme defines certain ranges as private addresses. These ranges are defined by RFC 1918 and are sometimes referred to as RFC 1918 addresses. Hosts with IP addresses from these ranges are not allowed to route traffic over the Internet. Use of the addresses is confined to private LANs. There are three private address ranges, each associated with one of the default subnet masks:\n• 10.0.0.0 to 10.255.255.255 (Class A private address range).\n• 172.16.0.0 to 172.31.255.255 (Class B private address range).\n• 192.168.0.0 to 192.168.255.255 (Class C private address range).\n• 169.254.0.0 to 169.254.255.255 (APIPA/link-local autoconfiguration).\n\nAs discussed earlier, this range is used by hosts for autoconfiguration when a DHCP server cannot be contacted (selecting a link-local address). Internet access can be facilitated for hosts using the private addressing scheme in two ways:\n• Through a router configured with a single or block of valid public addresses; the router translates between the private and public addresses using Network Address Translation (NAT).\n• Through a proxy server that fulfills requests for Internet resources on behalf of clients.\n\nNETWORK ADDRESS TRANSLATION\nMost hosts on private networks are not configured with IP addresses that can communicate directly to the Internet. Instead, when clients on the local network connect via a router, the router converts the client's private IP address into a valid public address using Network Address Translation (NAT)\n\nA NAT address pool supports multiple simultaneous connections but is still limited by the number of available public IP addresses. Smaller companies may only be allocated a single or small block of addresses by their ISP. In this case, a means for multiple private IP addresses to be mapped onto a single public address would be useful, and this is exactly what is provided by Network Address Port Translation (NAPT), which is also referred to as Port Address Translation (PAT) or as NAT overloading.\n\n(https://4sorcero.s3.amazonaws.com/byteback/core_1/fig_core_1_287.png)\nNAT overloading. (Image © 123RF.com.)\n\nNAPT works by allocating each new connection a high level TCP or UDP port. For example, say two hosts (10.0.0.101 and 10.0.0.103) initiate a web connection at the same time, requesting responses on the client (or source) port 1024. The NAPT service creates two new client port mappings for these requests (10.0.0.101:60101 and 10.0.0.103:60103). It then substitutes the private source IPs for a single public source IP (217.45.253.5) and forwards the requests to the public Internet. It performs a reverse mapping on any traffic returned to those client ports, inserting the original private IP address and client port number, and forwarding the packets to the internal hosts.\n\nVIRTUAL PRIVATE NETWORKS\nA Virtual Private Network (VPN) connects the components and resources of two (private) networks over another (public) network. The Internet provides a cost effective way of connecting both users to networks and networks to networks. Rather than a user direct-dialing your server, which is private but expensive, the user connects to an ISP, which is cheap, but public.\n\nA VPN is a "tunnel" through the Internet (or any other public network). It uses special connection protocols and encryption technology to ensure that the tunnel is secure and the user is properly authenticated. Once the connection has been established, to all intents and purposes, the remote computer becomes part of the local network (though it is still restricted by the bandwidth available over the WAN link).\n\n(https://4sorcero.s3.amazonaws.com/byteback/core_1/fig_core_1_288.png)\nA typical VPN configuration.

IPv6\nThe addressing scheme discussed earlier is for IP version 4. Because it is feared the global supply of IPv4 addresses will run out, a new version of IP addressing, IP Version 6, has been developed. An IPv6 address is a 128-bit number (contrast with the 32-bit number used in v4). This massively increases the available pool of available addresses compared to IPv4. IPv6 also includes new efficiency features, such as simplified address headers, hierarchical addressing, support for time-sensitive network traffic, and a new structure for unicast addressing.\n\nBINARY AND HEXADECIMAL NOTATION\nNetwork addresses are represented as binary values when processed by the computer but because binary has only two values for each position and the values for IPv6 addresses are very large, this would require a long string of characters to write out. This is difficult enough to read but even harder to type accurately into configuration dialogs.\n\nBinary values are converted to decimal for IPv4 addresses but as IPv6 addresses are so much longer, hexadecimal notation is used. Hexadecimal has 16 characters (0...9 plus A, B, C, D, E, F). Therefore, it only takes 1 hexadecimal character to represent 4 binary characters. The following table summarizes the equivalent representations of decimal values from 0-15 in binary and hex.\n\n(https://4sorcero.s3.amazonaws.com/byteback/core_1/table_core_1_288.png)\n(https://4sorcero.s3.amazonaws.com/byteback/core_1/table_core_1_289.png)\n\nDecimal Hexadecimal Binary\n0 0 0000\n1 1 0001\n2 2 0010\n3 3 0011\n4 4 0100\n5 5 0101\n6 6 0110\n7 7 0111\n8 8 1000\n9 9 1001\n10 A 1010\n11 B 1011\n12 C 1100\n13 D 1101\n14 E 1110\n15 F 1111\n\nIPv6 ADDRESS NOTATION\nTo express a 128-bit IPv6 address in hexadecimal notation, the binary address is divided into eight double-byte (16-bit) values delimited by colons. For example:\n\n2001:0db8:0000:0000:0abc:0000:def0:1234\n\nEven this is quite cumbersome, so where a double-byte contains leading zeros, they can be ignored. In addition, one contiguous series of zeroes can be replaced by a double colon place marker. Thus, the address above would become:\n\n2001:db8::abc:0:def0:1234\n\nIPv6 ADDRESSING SCHEMES\nAn IPv6 address is divided into two main parts: the first 64 bits are used as a network ID while the second 64 bits designate a specific interface.\n\n(https://4sorcero.s3.amazonaws.com/byteback/core_1/fig_core_1_289.png)\nIn IPV6, the interface identifier is always the last 64 bits; the first 64 bits are used for network addressing. (Image © 123RF.com.)\n\nAs the network and host portions are fixed size, there is no need for a subnet mask. Network addresses are written using prefix notation, where /nn is the length of the routing prefix in bits. Within the 64-bit network ID, the length of any given network prefix is used to determine whether two addresses belong to the same IP network.\n\nGLOBALLY UNIQUE UNICAST ADDRESSING\nAs with IPv4, a unicast address identifies a single network interface. The main types of unicast addressing are global and link-local. A   is one that is unique on the Internet (equivalent to public addresses in IPv4). Global unicast addresses have the following format:\n• The first 3 bits indicate that the address is within the global scope. In hex notation, a global unicast address will start with either "2" or "3."\n• The next 45 bits are allocated in a hierarchical manner to regional registries and from them to ISPs and end users.\n• The next 16 bits identity site-specific subnet addresses.\n• The final 64 bits are the interface ID. The interface ID is either generated from the adapter's MAC address (padded with extra bits to make it 64 bits in length) or is randomly generated.\n\n(https://4sorcero.s3.amazonaws.com/byteback/core_1/fig_core_1_290a.png)\nIPv6 global unicast address format. (Image © 123RF.com.)\n\nIn IPv6, address blocks are automatically assigned hierarchically by routers. Top-level routers have top-level address blocks, which are automatically divided and assigned as routers and segments are added. This divides the address space as a logical hierarchy, compared to the ad-hoc address-space management procedures that were developed for IPv4, making it easier to manage.\n\nLINK-LOCAL ADDRESSING\nLink-local addresses are used by IPv6 for network housekeeping traffic. Link-local addresses span a single subnet (they are not forwarded by routers). Nodes on the same link are referred to as neighbors. In hex notation, link-local addresses start with\n\nfe80::\n\n(https://4sorcero.s3.amazonaws.com/byteback/core_1/fig_core_1_290b.png)\nIPv6 link-local unicast address format. (Image © 123RF.com.)\n\nThe equivalent in IPv4 is Automatic Private IP Addressing (APIPA) and its 169.254.0.0 addresses. However, unlike IPv4, an IPv6 host is always configured with link-local addresses (one for each link), even if it also has a globally unique address.\ntag:C1 L5 TE

Activity 5-5\nDiscussing Network Configuration Concepts\n\nSCENARIO\nAnswer the following questions to check your understanding of the topic.\n\nQuestion 1. What is the difference between a router and a modem?\n\nAnswer 1.  A router is a device that can forward traffic between different logical networks. These networks might use different media and different ways of transporting frames across links. In an Ethernet network, a host interfaces with the local network (LAN) using a network adapter. When a link is point-to-point, using media such as a telephone line, a modem is used to convert the signals that can be carried over the media from the LAN format to the WAN format. Where a router is connected to such links, it may be installed with a modem, but the functions of the devices are separate. The modem makes a physical network link with the ISP network, functioning at the same level as a switch. The router can make decisions about forwarding between logical networks.\n\nQuestion 2. Protocols within the TCP/IP suite (and products supporting TCP/IP networks) are conceived as working at one of four layers. What are those four layers called?\n\nAmswer 2. Link/Network Interface, Internet, Transport, and Application.\n\nQuestion 3. What is meant by dotted decimal notation?\n\nAnswer 3. An IPv4 address is a 32-bit number expressed as four octets (bytes). A byte can be expressed as the decimal values 0 to 255, and these are used to represent the IP address, with dots between each decimal number. This scheme is easier for people to read than a binary number and reduces configuration errors.\n\nQuestion 4. When is a default gateway required?\n\nAnswer 4. When a host needs to communicate with hosts located outside its own IP network.\n\nQuestion 5. A host is configured with the IP address 192.168.1.10/24. What is the host's subnet mask?\n\nAnswer 5. 255.255.255.0.\n\nQuestion 6. What is the purpose of a DHCP server?\n\nAnswer 6. A Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) server automatically allocates a TCP/IP configuration (IP address, subnet mask, default gateway, and DNS servers) to hosts when they join the network.\n\nQuestion 7. What is special about an IP address that starts 169.254?\n\nAnswer 7. It is an APIPA address—that is, one automatically selected if the interface is configured to use DHCP but cannot contact a DHCP server.\n\nQuestion 8. A host is configured with the IP address 172.29.0.101. What is significant about this address?\n\nAnswer 8. It is a private address and cannot be reached directly over the Internet. The host must use a router with address translation or a proxy service to communicate on the Internet.\n\nQuestion 9. What is the function of NAT?\n\nAnswer 9. Network Address Translation (NAT) enables a router to map private network IP addresses onto a public IP address. Private addressing keeps the local network more secure and reduces the demand for unique IP addresses.\n\nQuestion 10. Apart from its length, what is the main difference between the structure of an IPv4 address and an IPv6 address?\n\nAnswer 10. Both types of IP address identify a host within a specific logical network. In an IPv4 address, the network ID portion is determined by applying a mask to the whole address. In an IPv6 address, the host portion is always the last 64 bits of the address. The first 64 bits are used with network prefixes to identify networks and subnetworks.\ntag:C1 L5 TE A5-5

Topic F\nNetwork Services\n\nEXAM OBJECTIVES COVERED\n1001-2.1 Compare and contrast TCP and UDP ports, protocols, and their purposes.\n1001-2.5 Summarize the properties and purposes of services provided by networked\nhosts.\n\nIn the previous topics, you explored the network hardware and protocols that facilitate the process of making connections between hosts and networks, including Internet connections. In this topic, you will move on to examine the various ports and protocols that are used to provide application services. Properly configuring the ports of a network device and selecting the right protocol will ensure that data gets transmitted over the network. As a CompTIA A+ technician, you must understand how ports and protocols are implemented within a network and how they function to provide the right level of data transmission while keeping data secure.\ntag:C1 L5 TF

TCP AND UDP PORTS\nThe protocols we have looked at so far are primarily concerned with moving frames and packets between nodes and networks. At the link/physical layer, Ethernet allows nodes to send one another frames of data using MAC addresses. These frames would typically be transporting IP packets. At the network layer, IP provides addressing and routing functionality for a network of networks (or internetwork).\n\nProtocols at the transport layer, one up from the network layer, are concerned with effective delivery. At the transport layer, the content of the packets starts to become significant.\n\nAny given host on a network will be communicating with many other hosts using many different types of networking data. One of the critical functions of the transport layer is to identify each type of network application. It does this by assigning each application a between 0 and 65535. For example, data addressed to the HTTP web browsing application can be identified as port 80 while data requesting an email application service can be identified as port 143. At the transport layer, on the sending host, data from the upper layers is packaged as a series of segments and each segment is tagged with the application's port number. The segment is then passed to the network layer for delivery. The host could be transmitting multiple HTTP and email segments at the same time. These are multiplexed using the port numbers onto the same network link.\n\nNote: In fact, each host assigns two port numbers. On the client, the destination port number is mapped to the service that the client is requesting (HTTP on port 80, for instance). The client also assigns a random source port number (47747, for instance). The server uses this client-assigned port number (47747) as the destination port number for its replies and its application port number (80 for HTTP) as its source port. This allows the hosts to track multiple "conversations" for the same application protocol.\n\nAt the network and data link layers, the port number is not significant—it becomes part of the data payload and is "invisible" to routers and switches working at the network and data link layers. At the receiving host, each segment is extracted from its frame and then identified by its port number and passed up to the relevant handler at the application layer.\n\nTCP VERSUS UDP\nThe transport layer is also responsible for ensuring reliable data delivery so that packets arrive error-free and without loss. The transport layer can overcome lack of reliability in the lower level protocols. This reliability is achieved by the Transport Control Protocol (TCP) using acknowledgement messages that inform the sender the data was successfully received.\n\nThe kinds of problems that may occur during the delivery of the data are non-delivery and delivery in a damaged state. In the first case, the lack of acknowledgement results in the retransmission of the data and, in the second case, a Acknowledgement (NACK) forces retransmission. TCP is described as connection-oriented, because it ensures  the reliability and sequencing of messages passing over the connection.\n\nOn the other hand, sometimes it is more important that communications be faster than they are reliable. The acknowledgements process of TCP adds a lot of overhead. The User Datagram Protocol (UDP) is a connectionless, non-guaranteed method of communication with no sequencing or flow control. There is no guarantee regarding the delivery of messages or the sequence in which packets are received. UDP is suitable for applications that do not require acknowledgement of receipt and can tolerate missing or out-of-order packets. It may be used for applications that transfer time-sensitive data but do not require complete reliability, such as voice or video. The reduced overhead means that delivery is faster. If necessary, the application layer can be used to control delivery reliability.\ntag:C1 L5 TF

WELL-KNOWN PORTS\nAny application or process that uses TCP or UDP for its transport, such as HTTP for web services or POP3 for email, is assigned a unique identification number called a port. The server and client applications use different ports. For example, a client may contact an HTTP server at IP address 77.72.206.10 on port 80 (77.72.206.10:80). The HTTP server would respond to the client on a temporary (or ephemeral) port number that the client has opened for that purpose (47747, for instance).\n\nServer port numbers are assigned by the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA).\n\nSome of the "well-known" port numbers are listed in the following table.\n\n(https://4sorcero.s3.amazonaws.com/byteback/core_1/table_core_1_295.png)\n(https://4sorcero.s3.amazonaws.com/byteback/core_1/table_core_1_296.png)\n\nPort # TCP/UDP Process Description\n20 TCP ftp-data File Transfer Protocol - Data\n21 TCP ftp File Transfer Protocol - Control\n22 TCP ssh Secure Shell\n23 TCP telnet Telnet\n25 TCP smtp Simple Mail Transfer Protocol\n53 TCP/UDP domain Domain Name System\n67 UDP bootps BOOTP/DHCP Server\n68 UDP bootpc BOOTP/DHCP Client\n80 TCP http HTTP\n110 TCP pop3 Post Office Protocol\n123 UDP ntp Network Time Protocol\n137-139 UDP/TCP netbt NetBIOS over TCP/IP\n143 TCP imap4 Internet Mail Access Protocol\n161 UDP snmp Simple Network Management Protocol\n162 UDP snmp-trap Simple Network Management Protocol Trap\n389 TCP ldap Lightweight Directory Access Protocol\n427 TCP slp Service Location Protocol\n443 TCP https HTTP Secure\n445 TCP smb Server Message Block/Common Internet File System\n548 TCP afp Apple Filing Protocol\n3389 TCP rdp Remote Desktop Protocol\n\nIANA defines the ephemeral port range as 49152 to 65535, but some operating systems use different values.\n\nEnabling and disabling ports is an important part of configuring a firewall, to ensure that only valid application protocols are allowed.\n\nThe TCP/IP suite encompasses a large number and wide range of protocols. Some of the principal protocols amongst these are discussed in the following sections.\ntag:C1 L5 TF

DNS\nThe Domain Name System (DNS) is a hierarchical system for resolving names to IP addresses. It uses a distributed database that contains information on domains and hosts within those domains. The information is distributed among many name servers, each of which holds part of the database. The distributed nature of the system has the twin advantages that maintenance of the system is delegated and loss of one DNS server does not prevent name resolution from being performed.\n\nAt the top of the DNS hierarchy is the root, which is often represented by a period (.). There are 13 root level servers (A to M). Immediately below the root lie the Top Level Domains(TLDs). There are several types of top level domain, but the most prevalent are generic (.com, .org, .net, .info, .biz), sponsored (.gov, .edu), and country code (.uk, .ca, .de).\n\nThe domain name system is operated by ICANN (icann.org), who also manage the generic top level domains. Country codes are generally managed by an organization appointed by the relevant government. Each domain name has to be registered with a Domain Name Registry for the appropriate top level domain.\n\nInformation about a domain is found by tracing records from the root down through the hierarchy. The root servers have complete information about the top level domain servers. In turn, these servers have information relating to servers for the second level domains.\n\nNo name server has complete information about all domains. Records within the DNS tell them where the missing information is found.\n\n(https://4sorcero.s3.amazonaws.com/byteback/core_1/fig_core_1_296a.png)\nDNS hierarchy. (Image © 123RF.com.)\n\nFULLY QUALIFIED DOMAIN NAME\nThe full name of any host is called its Fully Qualified Domain Name (FQDN). FQDNs reflect the hierarchy, from most specific (the host) to least specific (the top level domain followed by the root). For example: www.widget.com.\n\nThe structure of a FQDN follows a fixed hierarchy, with the top level of the hierarchy shown to the right of the name. Each part of the name (a label) is separated by period characters (full stops). Any given label can consist of letters, numbers, and hyphens (though it cannot start with a hyphen).\n\nThe domain name identifies a company, organization, or even an individual. The name has to be unique and officially registered (a process that is normally handled by your ISP).\n\nHost names and local domains are specified within the organization (for example, to identify a server located in the sales department of a company). The www host name is a common alias to indicate that the resource is a web server.\n\n(https://4sorcero.s3.amazonaws.com/byteback/core_1/fig_core_1_296b.png)\nParts of two FQDNs with 1) Top level domain; 2) Subdomain; 3) Host name. (Image © 123RF.com.)\n\nDNS SERVERS\nDifferent types of DNS servers are used by private organizations:\n• Authoritative name server—this type of DNS server holds domain records and can respond authoritatively to requests for information about hosts in the domain(s) it manages. On a private network, such as an Active Directory (AD) domain, a name server must be running to host the AD DNS records. These records would not be made publicly available outside the LAN. On the Internet, public information about a domain, such as the location of its web and email servers, will be published to a name server. These are usually hosted by ISPs.\n• Recursive resolver—when a client application wants to resolve a name or FQDN, it uses a recursive resolver to perform the query. The resolver contacts name servers in the DNS hierarchy until it either locates the requested record or times out. When you configure a DNS server on a client, it is usually the address of a resolver that you are entering.\n\nNote: On a private network, the same DNS server is likely to be identified for both functions. For example, an AD DNS server might both host the DNS records and provide name resolution for other Internet domain requests (typically by forwarding them to another server). Alternatively, the network might use client-facing forwarding-only servers whose only purpose is to select the best DNS server to answer a particular request and forward it on.\n\nA DNS server is usually configured to listen for queries on UDP port 53.\ntag:C1 L5 TF

WEB SERVERS AND HTTP/HTTPS\nA web server is one that provides client access using the HyperText Transfer Protocol (HTTP) or its secure version (HTTPS).\n\nHTTP AND HTML\nHyperText Transfer Protocol (HTTP) is the basis of the World Wide Web. HTTP enables clients (typically web browsers) to request resources from an HTTP server. A client connects to the HTTP server using its TCP port (the default is port 80) and submits a request for a resource, using a Uniform Resource Locator (URL). The server acknowledges the request and returns the data.\n\nTypically, an organization will lease a server or space on a server from an ISP. Larger organizations with their own Internet Point-of-Presence may host websites themselves. Web servers are not only used on the Internet, however. Private networks using web technologies are described as intranets (if they permit only local access) or (if they permit remote access).\n\nHTTP is usually used to serve HyperText Markup Language (HTML) web pages, which are plain text files with coded tags describing how the page should be formatted. A web browser can interpret the tags and display the text and other resources associated with the page (such as picture or sound files). Another powerful feature is its ability to provide hyperlinks to other related documents. HTTP also features forms mechanisms (GET and POST) whereby a user can submit data from the client to the server.\n\nThe functionality of HTTP servers is often extended by support for scripting and programmable features (web applications).\n\nUNIFORM RESOURCE LOCATOR\nResources on the Internet are accessed using an addressing scheme known as a Uniform Resource Locator (URL). A URL contains all the information necessary to identify and access an item. For example, a URL for an HTTP resource might contain the following elements:\n• The protocol describes the access method or service type being used.\n• The host location is usually represented by a Fully Qualified Domain Name (FQDN). The FQDN is not case sensitive. The host location can also be an IP address; an IPv6 address must be enclosed in square brackets.\n• The file path specifies the directory and file name location of the resource (if required). The file path may or may not be case-sensitive, depending on how the server is configured.\n\n(https://4sorcero.s3.amazonaws.com/byteback/core_1/fig_core_1_297.png)\nURL with 1) Protocol; 2 FQDN; 3) File path. (Image © 123RF.com.)\n\nSSL/TLS\nOne of the critical problems for the provision of early e-commerce sites was the lack of security in HTTP. Under HTTP, all data is sent unencrypted and there is no Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) authentication of client or server.   was developed by Netscape and released as version 3.0 in 1996 to address these problems. SSL proved Transport Layer Security very popular with the industry and is still in widespread use. (TLS) was developed from SSL and ratified as a standard by IETF. TLS is now the product in active development, with 1.2 as the latest version.\n\nSSL/TLS is typically used with the HTTP application (referred to as  HTTPS or HTTP Over SSL or HTTP Secure) but can also be used to secure other TCP/IP application protocols. TLS can also be used with UDP applications, referred to as  Datagram Transport Layer Security (DTLS). Some VPN solutions depend on the use of DTLS.\n\nNote: HTTPS operates over port 443 by default. HTTPS operation is indicated by using https:// for the URL and by a padlock icon shown in the browser.\n\nThe basic function of TLS is:\n1. A server is assigned a digital certificate by some trusted Certificate Authority. \n2. The certificate proves the identity of the server (assuming that the client trusts the Certificate Authority.\n3. The server uses the digital certificate and the SSL/TLS protocol to encrypt communications between it and the client.\n\nThis means that the communications cannot be read or changed by a third party.\n\nNote: It is also possible to install a certificate on the client so that the server can trust the client. This is not often used on the web but is a feature of VPNs.\ntag:C1 L5 TF

MAIL SERVERS\nEmail is a messaging system that can be used to transmit text messages and binary file attachments encoded using Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions (MIME). Email can involve the use of multiple protocols. The following process illustrates how an email message is sent from a typical corporate mail gateway (using the Microsoft Exchange mail server) to a recipient with subscriber Internet access:\n1. The email client software on the sender's computer (sender@515support.com) sends the message to the Exchange email server using Microsoft's Message Application Programming Interface or allowing a (MAPI)protocol. The mail server puts the Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP) session to be started. SMTP uses TCP port 25 by default.\n2. When the Exchange SMTP server starts to process the queue, it first contacts a DNS server to resolve the recipient's address (for example, recipient@othercompany.com) to an IP address for the othercompany.com email server, listed as a Mail Exchanger (MX) record in DNS.\n3. It then uses SMTP to deliver the message to this email server. The delivery usually requires several "hops"; for example, from the mail gateway to the sender\'s ISP, then to the recipient's ISP. The hops taken by a message as it is delivered over the Internet are recorded in the message header.\n4. The message is put in the message store on the recipient's mail server. To retrieve it, the recipient uses his or her mail client software to connect with the mailbox on the server, using the Post Office Protocol (POP3) on TCP port 110 or Internet Message Access Protocol (IMAP) on TCP port 143. POP3 is more widely implemented, but IMAP provides extra features, such as support for mail folders other than inbox on the server and calendar functionality.\n\nNote: Email communications between a client and server would normally be protected with SSL/TLS security. The default port numbers for these are 587 (SMTPS), 993 (IMAPS), and 995 (POP3S).\n\nTo configure an email account, you need the username, password, and default email address, plus incoming and outgoing server addresses and protocol types from the ISP.\n\n(https://4sorcero.s3.amazonaws.com/byteback/core_1/fig_core_1_299.png)\nConfiguring an email account. The incoming server is either POP or IMAP while the outgoing server is SMTP. (Screenshot used with permission from Microsoft)\n\nInternet email addresses follow the mailto URL scheme. An Internet email address comprises two parts—the username (local part) and the domain name, separated by an @ symbol. The domain name may refer to a company or an ISP; for example, david.martin@comptia.org or david.martin@aol.com.\n\nDifferent mail systems have different requirements for allowed and disallowed characters in the local part. The local part is supposed to be case-sensitive, but most mail systems do not treat it as such. An incorrectly addressed email will be returned with a message notifying that it was undeliverable. Mail may also be rejected if it is identified as spam or if there is some other problem with the user mailbox (such as the mailbox being full).\n\nOf course, there are many more network communication types than email. Network services are equally likely to support Voice over IP, videoconferencing, messaging, and integration with social media.\ntag:C1 L5 TF

FILE AND PRINTER SHARING\nOne of the core network functions is to provide shared access to disk and print resources. These services may be performed using proprietary protocols, such as File and Print Services for Windows Networks. A file server could also be implemented using standard protocols, such as File Transfer Protocol (FTP), though this lacks a lot of the functionality of Windows file services.\n\nSERVER MESSAGE BLOCK (SMB)/COMMON INTERNET FILE SYSTEM (CIFS)\nServer Message Block (SMB)is the application protocol underpinning file and printer  sharing on Windows networks. In all supported versions of Windows, version 2 of the protocol is used (SMB2), though there is support for legacy Windows clients. SMB usually runs directly over TCP on port 445 but can also run as part of NetBIOS over TCP/IP, over UDP and TCP in the port range 137-139. The Samba software package implements the protocol for Linux computers, enabling them to share and access resources on an otherwise Windows-based network. SMB is also sometimes referred Common Internet File System (CIFS)\n\nAPPLE FILING PROTOCOL (AFP)\nThe Apple Filing Protocol (AFP) performs a similar file sharing function to SMB but for Apple networks running Mac OS. AFP is associated with the use of two ports:\n• UDP or TCP port 427—this is a port running the Service Location Protocol, used to advertise the availability of file shares. It is not required by later versions of OS X (10.2 and up).\n• TCP port 548—this is the main port used by AFP.\n\nNote: Apple is phasing out support for AFP in favor of its own version of SMB2 (SMBX).\n\nFILE TRANSFER PROTOCOL (FTP)\nThe File Transfer Protocol (FTP) was one of the earliest protocols used on TCP/IP networks and the Internet. As its name suggests, it allows a client to upload and download files from a remote server. It is widely used to upload files to websites. Also, if you have existing files that you want to make available to remote users, FTP is a simple service to install and maintain. Files made available through FTP can be in any format, including document, multimedia, or application files.\n\nFTP is associated with the use of TCP port 21 to establish a connection and either TCP port 20 to transfer data in "active" mode or a server-assigned port in "passive" mode.\n\nThe FTP client may take a number of forms:\n• Most installations of TCP/IP include a command-line client interface. The commands get and put are used to upload and download files, respectively.\n• Dedicated GUI clients allow you to connect to servers, browse directories, and upload and download files.\n• Internet browsers allow you to connect to an FTP service and download files. You use another type of URL to connect to an FTP server; for example, ftp.microsoft.com/.\n\n(https://4sorcero.s3.amazonaws.com/byteback/core_1/fig_core_1_301.png)\nConfiguring a site in an FTP client. (Screenshot used with permission from Microsoft.)\n\nNote: Plain FTP is unencrypted and so poses a high security risk. Passwords for sites are submitted in plaintext. There are ways of encrypting FTP sessions (FTPS and SFTP), however, and it is the encrypted services that are most widely used now.\ntag:C1 L5 TF

NETWORK HOST SERVICES\nThe purpose of a network is to make host services available. There are many categories of network service, but some of the most important roles are described here.\n\nAUTHENTICATION SERVER\nMost networks have some sort of access control system to prevent unauthorized users (and devices) from connecting. In a Windows homegroup, for example, the access control method is a simple password, shared with all authorized users. Enterprise networks use authentication servers to configure user accounts and authenticate the subjects trying to use those accounts. On a Windows domain, the user database and authentication service is provided by Active Directory, using a mechanism based on the Kerberos protocol.\n\nYou are also likely to come across the terms AAA server and RADIUS server. An Authentication, Authorization, and Accounting (AAA) server is one that consolidates authentication services across multiple access devices, such as switches, routers, and access points. Remote Authentication Dial-in User Service (RADIUS) is an example of an AAA protocol.\n\nDHCP AND DNS SERVERS\nAuthentication is just one part of providing network access. Hosts must also receive a suitable network configuration to be able to communicate on the network. DHCP and DNS are two of the services that facilitate this:\n• Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) servers assign IP address information to host automatically when they connect to the network.\n• Domain Name System (DNS) servers allow users to access resources using host names and Fully Qualified Domain Names (FQDN) by resolving those names to IP addresses.\n\nLIGHTWEIGHT DIRECTORY ACCESS PROTOCOL (LDAP)\nNetwork resources can be recorded as objects within a directory. A directory is like a database, where an object is like a record and things that you know about the object (attributes) are like fields. In order for products from different vendors to be interoperable, most directories are based on the same standard.\n\nThe main directory standard is the X.500 series of standards, developed by the International Telecommunications Union (ITU) in the 1980s.\n\nThe problem with X.500 is that the full set of standards specified the use of a complex protocol stack as a means of network access, at a time when most organizations were already opting to use TCP/IP. Researchers developed a means for clients to connect to an X.500 server over TCP/IP and this was standardized by the IETF as the Directory Access Protocol (LDAP). LDAP is a protocol used to query and update an X. 500 directory, or any type of directory that can present itself as an X.500 directory. It is widely supported in current directory products—Windows Active Directory, Apple OpenDirectory, or the open source OpenLDAP, for instance.\n\nLDAP uses TCP and UDP port 389 by default.\n\nA Distinguished Name is a unique identifier for any given resource within the directory. A distinguished name is made up of attribute-value pairs, separated by commas. Examples of attributes include Common Name (CN), Organizational Unit (OU), and Domain Component (DC). The most specific attribute is listed first and successive attributes become progressively broader. This most specific attribute is also referred to as the Relative Distinguished Name, as it uniquely identifies the object within the context of successive (parent) attribute values.\n\nNetBOIS/ NetBT\nThe very earliest Windows networks used network software called the Network Basic Input/Output System (NetBIOS). NetBIOS allowed computers to address one another by name and establish sessions. As the TCP/IP suite became the standard for local networks, NetBIOS was re-engineered to work over the TCP and UDP protocols, referred to as NetBIOS over TCP/IP (NetBT):\n• Name service (UDP port 137).\n• Datagram transmission service (UDP port 138).\n• Session service (TCP port 139).\n\nAs you know, modern networks use IP, TCP/UDP, and DNS for these functions. NetBT should be disabled on most networks. It is only required if the network has to support pre-Windows 2000 legacy systems (plus some network applications).\ntag:C1 L5 TF

INVENTORY MANAGEMENT SERVERS\nInventory management refers to keeping a record of the systems running on your network. This is not a simple task to try to perform manually, so a number of protocols have been developed to assist.\n\nSIMPLE NETWORK MANAGEMENT PROTOCOL (SNMP)\nThe Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) is a framework for management and monitoring network devices. SNMP consists of a management system and agents.\n\nThe agent is a process running on a switch, router, server, or other SNMP-compatible network device. This agent maintains a database called a Management Information Base (MIB) that holds statistics relating to the activity of the device. An example of such a statistic is the number of frames per second handled by a switch. The agent is also capable of initiating a trap operation where it informs the management system of a notable event (port failure, for instance). The threshold for triggering traps can be set for each value.\n\n(https://4sorcero.s3.amazonaws.com/byteback/core_1/fig_core_1_303.png)\nSNMP agents and management system. (Image © 123RF.com.)\n\nThe management system (a software program) provides a location from which network activity can be overseen. It monitors all agents by polling them at regular intervals for information from their MIBs and displays the information for review. It also displays any trap operations as alerts for the network administrator to assess and act upon as necessary.\n\nSNMP device queries take place over UDP port 161; traps are communicated over UDP port 162.\n\nENDPOINT MANAGEMENT SERVER\nModern security models recognize that networks must not just apply security controls at the perimeter or border. A security principle called defense in depth calls for policies such as workstation hardening to ensure they cannot be compromised and used to attack the network from within. Of course, modern networks do not just consist of computer workstations—any type of endpoint computing device must be protected too, including laptops, smartphones, tablets, printers, and "smart" appliances.\n\nAn Endpoint Management Server facilitates this process by identifying computing devices running on the network and ensuring that they are securely configured. This might mean applying OS and antivirus updates automatically, cataloging software applications installed on each device, applying security policies, retrieving and analyzing log files, and monitoring performance and other status alerts. Microsoft has the System Center and Configuration Manager (SCCM) for Windows (plus support for other device types). There are many other product examples.\n\nsyslog\nEffective network management often entails capturing logs from different devices. It is much easier to review logs and respond to alerts if the logs are consolidated on a single system.\n\nPrior to Windows 7, one limitation of Windows logs was that they only logged local events. This meant that third party tools were required in order to gain an overall view of messaging for the entire network. However, the development of event subscriptions allows logging to be configured to forward all events to a single computer, enabling a holistic view of network events.\n\nThe equivalent system in UNIX and Linux is usually syslog. This was designed to follow a client-server model and so allows for centralized collection of events from multiple sources. It also provides an open format for event logging messages and as such, has become a de facto standard for logging events from distributed systems. For example, syslog messages can be generated by Cisco routers and switches, as well as servers and workstations, and collected in a central database for viewing and analysis.\ntag:C1 L5 TF

LEGACY AND EMBEDDED SYSTEMS\nAn embedded system is a computer system that is designed to perform a specific, dedicated function. These systems can be as small and simple as a microcontroller in an intravenous drip-rate meter or as large and complex as an industrial control system managing a water treatment plant. Embedded systems might typically have been designed to operate within a closed network; that is one where the elements of the network are all known to the system vendor and there is no connectivity to wider computer data networks. Where embedded systems need to interact within a computer data network, there are special considerations to make in terms of the network design, especially as regards security.\n\nA legacy system is one that is no longer directly supported by its vendor. Networks often need to retain hosts running DOS or legacy versions of Windows (XP and earlier) or old-style mainframe computers to run services that are too complex or expensive to migrate to a more modern platform. Legacy systems usually work well for what they do (which is why they don't get prioritized for replacement) but they represent very severe risks in terms of security vulnerabilities. It is important to isolate them as far as possible from the rest of the network and ensure any network channels linking them are carefully protected and monitored.\n\nBoth legacy and embedded systems represent a risk in terms of maintenance and troubleshooting too, as they tend to require more specialist knowledge than modern, off-the-shelf, computing systems. Consultants with expertise in such systems can the limitations of these become highly sought after.\ntag:C1 L5 TF

INTERNET SECURITY APPLIANCES AND SOFTWARE\nNetworks connected to the inter net need to be protected against malicious hosts and applications by a firewall and anti-malware scanners. Networks also need to scan for "unusual" host behavior or network traffic, using Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) and Intrusion Prevention Systems (IPS). These services can be implemented on servers but enterprise networks are likely to use dedicated Internet security appliances.\n\nINTRUSION DETECTION SYSTEM (IDS)\nA network-based Intrusion Detection System (IDS) comprises a sensor plus an analysis engine that scans network traffic for signs of threats or other violations of security policy. The IDS can be programmed with signatures of known intrusion attempts. Like antivirus software, these intrusion signatures (usually called plug-ins in the context of IDS) must be kept up to date. Also like antivirus, IDS can use behavioral or heuristic techniques to identify potential threats. In contrast to a basic packet-filtering  firewall, which can be configured with rules about IP addresses and application protocol ports, a network-based IDS examines the contents of the application layer payload in the packet.\n\nWhen an IDS detects an intrusion event, it creates a log entry and can also send an alert to an administrator, if the event is considered important enough. One of the major drawbacks of IDS is the detection of too many innocuous events (false positives).\n\nThere are many vendors supplying IDS software and appliances. The underlying detection engine for most of these products is based either on Snort or Suricata. Each IDS solution adds its own connectivity (options for sensor placement), configuration, and reporting tools.\n\nINTRUSION PROTECTION SYSTEM (IPS)\nAn Intrusion Protection System (IPS) adds some sort of real-time blocking (or shunning) functionality on top of the basic IDS. An IPS may drop packets, reset connections, or run a script to trigger a response on another server or network device (firewall, switch, or router).\n\nUNIFIED THREAT MANAGEMENT (UTM)\nNetwork security applications include antivirus scanners, intrusion detection/ prevention, and firewalls. These might be deployed as separate appliances or server applications, each with its own configuration and logging/reporting system. A Unified Threat Management (UTM) appliance is one that enforces a variety of security-related measures, combining the work of a firewall, malware scanner, and intrusion detection/prevention. A UTM centralizes the threat management service, providing simpler configuration and reporting compared to isolated applications spread across several servers or devices. Some of the major UTM vendors and products include Barracuda, Sophos, Check Point, Fortinet, Cisco Meraki, Juniper SRVX, and Dell SonicWall.\n\nThere are two basic ways of implementing network connectivity for IDS and IPS or UTM server services and appliances:\n• Install the appliance inline with the network—this means that all network traffic passes through the server or appliance. This allows the appliance to block suspect traffic easily. The drawback is that a single appliance would represent a critical point of failure. If the forwarding function of the appliance were to fail, no traffic would be able to pass into or out of the network. This can be mitigated by using two or more appliances for redundancy.\n• Install the appliance as a sensor—this means that the appliance has a tap or mirror that enables it to view the traffic passing over a network link or switch. This makes prevention slower and more complex as the appliance must trigger a script for the preventive action to be enacted by another device (switch, router, or firewall).\n\nIn both cases, the ability to deal with high traffic volumes is critical. If the device is overwhelmed by the traffic volume, it will not be inspecting all of that traffic and could be allowing malicious traffic to pass undetected. A dedicated security appliance should be able to perform better in this respect than running the security service on a server or router.\n\nPROXY SERVER\nOn a SOHO network, devices on the LAN access the Internet via the router using a type of Network Address Translation (NAT), specifically Port-based Network Address Translation. This type of NAT device translates between the private IP addresses used on the LAN and the publicly addressable IP addresses used on the Internet.\n\nMany enterprise networks use some sort of NAT too but another option is to use a proxy server. A proxy server does not just translate IP addresses. It takes a whole HTTP request from a client, checks it, then forwards it to the destination computer on the Internet. When the reply comes back, it checks it, and then shuttles it back to the LAN computer. A proxy can be used for other types of traffic too (email, for instance).\n\nA proxy server can usually operate either as a transparent service, in which case the client requires no special configuration, or as non-transparent. For a non-transparent proxy, the client must be configured with the IP address and service port (often 8080 by convention) of the proxy server.\ntag:C1 L5 TF

Activity 5-6\nDiscussing Network Services\n\nSCENARIO\nAnswer the following questions to check your understanding of the topic.\n\nQuestion 1. If a network application cannot tolerate a missing packet, what type of transport protocol should it use?\n\nAnswer 1.Transmission Control Protocol (TCP).\n\nQuestion 2. True or false? Protocols that stream video and audio over the Internet are likely to be based on UDP.\n\nAnswer 2. True. UDP carries less overhead compared to Transmission Control Protocol (TCP), so is better suited to playing media files where small glitches due to lost packets are less of a problem than the whole video freezing.\n\nQuestion 3. What is DNS?\n\nAnswer 3. Domain Name System—servers that map host and domain names to IP addresses.\n\nQuestion 4. What configuration parameter must be entered to enable a client to use DNS?\n\nAnswer 4. The IP address of a DNS server on the local network or network reachable by the client.\n\nQuestion 5. True or false? An HTTP application secured using the SSL/TLS protocol should use a different port to unencrypted HTTP.\n\nAnswer 5. True. By default HTTPS uses port 443. It is possible in theory to apply SSL/TLS to port 80 but most browsers would not support this configuration.\n\nQusetion 6. What protocol would a mail client use to access the message store on a remote mail server?\n\nAnswer 6. Typically Post Office Protocol (POP3) or Internet Message Access Protocol (IMAP). A proprietary protocol such as MAPI (Microsoft Exchange) might also be used.\n\nQuestion 7. A firewall filters applications based on their port number. If you want to configure a firewall on the mail server to allow clients to download email messages, which port(s) might you have to open?\n\nAnswer 7. Either TCP port 993 (IMAPS) or 995 (POP3S), depending on the mail access protocol in use (IMAP or POP). These are the default ports for secure connections. Unsecure default ports are TCP port 143 and TCP port 110. Port 25 (SMTP) is used to send mail between servers, not to access messages stored on a server. Port 587 is often used by a client to submit messages for delivery by an SMTP server.\n\nQuestion 8. You are configuring a Network Attached Storage (NAS) appliance. What file sharing protocol(s) could you use to allow access to Windows, Linux, and Apple macOS clients?\n\nAnswer 8. Most clients should support Server Message Block (SMB)/Common Internet File System (CIFS). You might want to configure Apple Filing Protocol to support older macOS clients. Another option is to configure File Transfer Protocol (FTP).\n\nQuestion 9. What is the difference between SNMP and syslog?\n\nAnswer 9. The Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) provides a means for devices to report statistics to a management server. Syslog provides a means for devices to send log entries to a remote server.\n\nQuestion 10. You are advising a customer about types of security appliance. What are the principal types and configuration options?\n\nAnswer 10. A network Intrusion Detection System (IDS) scans packet contents for signs of traffic that could violate security policies. An Intrusion Protection System (IPS) can effect some sort of action to block such traffic. An IPS is usually provisioned as a Unified Threat Management (UTM) appliance to include firewall, anti-malware, and other security functionality. Appliances with blocking functionality are typically deployed inline with the network, so that all traffic passes through the appliance. Alternatively, a tap or sensor can be attached to the network so that traffic is copied for the appliance to read.\ntag:C1 L5 TF A5-6
