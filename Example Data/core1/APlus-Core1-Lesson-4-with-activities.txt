Lesson 4\nInstalling, Configuring, and Troubleshooting Internal System Components\n\nLESSON INTRODUCTION\nAs a CompTIA® A+® technician, you are not only responsible for the components outside the system unit, but all the internal components as well. On the job, you may be asked to connect peripheral components for a user, or you may be asked to swap out a motherboard. Having the knowledge and skills to properly install and configure the internal system components is crucial because, in most cases, users will not have the knowledge or the experience to install the components themselves. It will be your professional responsibility to know the technical specifications for these components and how to manage them appropriately.\n\nLESSON OBJECTIVES\nIn this lesson, you will:\n• Select and install a CPU to upgrade or repair a computer system.\n• Configure and update BIOS and UEFI.\n• Install power supplies.\n• Troubleshoot internal system components.\n• Configure a custom PC.\ntag: C1 L4

Topic A\nInstall and Upgrade CPUs\n\nEXAM OBJECTIVES COVERED\n1001-3.5 Given a scenario, install and configure motherboards, CPUs, and add-on cards. In this topic, you will examine the types and features of CPUs and cooling systems. Much like the motherboard, the CPU is another important component of the computer system that actually carries out all the tasks requested by the applications installed in the computer. The CPU is a heat generator, so part of understanding the CPU includes understanding how to manage heat inside the computer case by managing the airflow and temperature. Keeping the system cool is an easy but important way to maintain or even increase its productivity. A computer that runs too hot risks damaging its own components. As an A+ technician, you need to be familiar with these essential components of the computer system.\ntag: C1 L4 TA

CPU\nThe Central Processing Unit (CPU) processor, or simply the processor, executes program instruction code, performs mathematical and logical calculations, and controls Input/ Output (I/O) functions. The CPU is commonly described as the "brains" of a computer; in fact, it is better thought of as a very efficient sorting office. The CPU cannot think, but it can process simple instructions very, very quickly and efficiently. A computer is only as "clever" as its software.\n\nPC processors are produced by Intel  or other manufacturers who use the Intel instruction set and whose processors are, therefore, IBM  PC (or x86) compatible. Currently, only AMD (Advanced Micro Devices) falls into this category.\ntag: C1 L4 TA

CPU MANUFACTURING PROCESS\nNote: This information is provided for reference; it is not part of the exam objectives. microprocessor integrated circuit (IC)\n\nA microprocessor is a programmable integrated circuit. An IC is a silicon chip embedded on a ceramic plate. A silicon chip is a wafer of purified silicon doped with a metal oxide (typically copper or aluminum). This doping process creates millions of transistors and signal pathways within an area called the  . These transistors provide the electrical on/off states that are the basis of binary computer systems.\n\nThe process used to create the transistors is referred to as an n-micron or n-nanometer (nm) process, reflecting the size of the features (a transistor for instance) that can be created. A micron is a millionth of a meter; a nanometer is a billionth of a meter. This process has developed from 1 micron (80486) to 0.014 micron (or 14 nm).\n\nScaling down the process allows reduced voltages and therefore more speed with less heat. It also allows more components to be added to the same package, which has enabled innovations such as on-die cache, multicore CPUs, and on-die graphics processors.\ntag: C1 L4 TA

CPU ARCHITECTURES\nThe CPU is designed to run software programs. When a software program runs (whether it be an operating system, BIOS firmware, antivirus utility, or word processing application), it is assembled into instructions utilizing the fundamental of the CPU and loaded into system memory. The CPU then performs the following operations on these instructions:\n1. The control unit fetches the next instruction in sequence from system memory to the pipeline.\n2. The control unit decodes each instruction in turn and either executes it itself or Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU) Floating Point Unit (FPU) passes it to the Arithemitic Logic Unit (ALU) or Floating Point Unit (FPU) for execution.\n3. The result of the executed instruction is written back to a register or to system memory. A register is a temporary storage area available to the different units within the CPU.\n\nThis overview is grossly simplified, of course. Over the years, many different internal architectures have been developed to optimize the process of fetch, decode, execute, and writeback, while retaining compatibility with the basic x86 instruction set, which defines a CPU as IBM PC compatible.\ntag: C1 L4 TA

INSTRUCTION SETS\nThe instruction set used by IBM PC compatible CPUs is called x86-32 or IA-32 (Intel Architecture). The way the instructions are processed internally has been modified and optimized by various different CPU architectures, but otherwise the same platform has been in use for the last 30 years (IA-32 updated the 16-bit x86 instruction set, first Up until a few years ago, CPUs were designed to run 32-bit code. This means that each instruction can be up to 32-bits in length. A 32-bit CPU'sGeneral Purpose (GP) is greater memory are also 32-bits wide. However, since 2004, most desktop CPUs (and from 2006, most laptop CPUs) released to the market have been capable of running 64-bit capabilities.\n\nNote: 32-bit Pentium compatible CPUs feature additional larger registers for floating point calculations (80-bit) and SIMD processing (64- or 128-bit). They also feature a 64-bit data bus. It is the GP register size that makes a CPU 32- or 64-bit.\n\nIntel first developed a 64-bit instruction set for its Itanium server CPU platform in 2001. This platform (IA-64) has never gained acceptance in the PC market, however. AMD's 64-bit instruction set ( AMD64 ) has proved more popular and was adopted by Intel for its 64-bit desktop and mobile line. Intel refers to it as EM64T or Intel 64. The same instruction set is also called x86-64 or x64.\n\nThe utilization of 64-bit CPU features by installing 64-bit operating systems took some time to grow, principally because of the lack of 64-bit drivers for peripheral devices. However, at this point, it is estimated that well over half of the Windows install base is 64-bit.\ntag: C1 L4 TA

ADDRESSING\nThe system bus between the CPU and memory consists of a data bus and an address bus. The width of the data bus (64-bit on all current CPUs) determines how much data can be transferred per clock cycle; the width of the address bus determines how many memory locations the PC can access.\n\nNote: In modern CPU designs, the bus is double or quad "pumped," meaning that there are two or four 64-bit transfers per clock cycle. Also, the memory architecture is likely to be multi-channel, meaning that there are two, three, or four 64-bit data paths operating simultaneously.\n\nThe address bus for most 32-bit CPUs is either 32- or 36-bits wide. A 32-bit address bus can access a 4 GB address space; 36-bit expands that to 64 GB. In theory, a 64-bit CPU could implement a 64-bit address space (16 Exabytes). In practice, the current generation of x64 CPUs are "restricted" to 48-bit address spaces (256 TB) to reduce the complexity in remaining compatible with 32-bit software.\ntag: C1 L4 TA

CACHE\nA computer stores the data for the programs and files currently open in system memory. The CPU has registers to store instructions and data that it is processing. Instructions are moved in and out of these registers to the system memory. Cache is a small block of high-speed memory that enhances performance by pre-loading (caching) code and data from relatively slow system memory and passing it to the CPU on demand. Essentially, cache stores instructions and data that the CPU is using regularly.\n\nIn early CPU designs, cache was implemented as a separate chip on the motherboard, but almost all new CPUs incorporate most types of cache as features on the CPU itself (on die). Cache is designed in multiple levels. Level 1 cache is "closest" to the CPU and supports the fastest access. Level 2 cache is typically larger and a bit slower while Level 3 and Level 4 cache, if used, are larger and possibly a bit slower still.\ntag: C1 L4 TA

HYPERTHREADING\nOne way to make instruction execution more efficient is to improve the way the pipeline works. The basic approach is to do the most amount of work possible in a single clock cycle (multitasking ). There are various ways to achieve this goal, though.\n\n• Superpipelining. CPUs process multiple instructions at the same time (for example, while one instruction is fetched, another is being decoded, another is being executed, and another is being written back to memory). This is referred to as a superscalar architecture, as multiple execution units are required. Superscalar architectures also feature longer pipelines with multiple stages but shorter actions (micro-ops) at each stage, referred to as superpipelining.\nThe original Pentium  had a 5-stage pipeline; by contrast, the Pentium 4 has up to 31 stages (NetBurst  architecture). NetBurst actually proved relatively inefficient in terms of power and thermal performance, so Intel reverted to a modified form of the P6 architecture it used in Pentium IIs and IIIs for its "Core" brand CPUs (with around 14 stages).\n\n •  Multithreading. Another approach is Simultaneous Multithreading (SMT), called HyperThreading (HT) or HyperThreading Technology (HTT) A thread is a stream of instructions generated by a software application. Most applications run a single process in a single thread; software that runs multiple parallel threads within a process is said to be multithreaded. SMT allows the threads to run through the CPU at the same time. It duplicates many of the registers of the CPU. This reduces the amount of "idle time" the CPU spends waiting for new instructions to process. To the OS, it seems as though there are two or more CPUs installed.\n \nThe main drawback of SMT is that it works best with multithreaded software. As this software is more difficult to design, it tends to be restricted to programs designed to run on servers. Desktop applications software often cannot take full advantage.\ntag: C1 L4 TA

MULTIPROCESSING AND MULTICORE PROCESSORS\nYet another approach to making a computer system faster is to use two or more physical CPUs, referred to as Symmetric Multiprocessing (SMP). An SMP-aware OS can then make efficient use of the processing resources available to run application processes on whichever CPU is "available." This approach is not dependent on software applications being multithreaded to deliver performance benefits. Traditionally, SMP was provided by physically installing two or more CPUs in a multi-Dual core is now socket motherboard. Obviously, this adds significantly to the cost and so is implemented more often on servers and high-end workstations.\n\nHowever, improvements in CPU manufacturing techniques have led to another solution: dual-core CPUs, or Chip Level Multiprocessing (CMP). A dual-core CPU is essentially two processors combined on the same die. The market has quickly moved\nbeyond dual-core CPUs to multicore packages with 3, 4, 8, or more processors.\n\nNote: Most mainstream CPU models are now multicore. Single-core CPUs are still produced for the lowest budget models but manufacturing volumes mean that multicore CPUs are at the point of being cheaper to produce than single-core ones.\ntag: C1 L4 TA

CLOCK SPEED\nDespite the architectural features just discussed, the speed at which the CPU runs is generally seen as a key indicator of performance. This is certainly true when comparing CPUs with the same architecture but is not necessarily the case otherwise. Intel Core 2 CPUs run slower than Pentium 4s, but deliver better performance. Budget and low power models will work at around 1-2 GHz while premium models will run at 3-4 GHz.\n\nThe core clock speed is the speed at which the CPU runs internal processes and accesses L1 and L2 cache (L2 cache access speed actually depends on the CPU architecture, but full-speed access to L2 cache has been standard for some time). The Front Side Bus (FSB) speed is the interface between the CPU and system memory.\ntag: C1 L4 TA

OVERCLOCKING\nWhen a manufacturer releases a new chip, it sets an optimum clock speed based on systems testing. This clock speed will be set at a level where damage to the chip is not likely to occur during normal operation. Increasing this speed (overclocking) is done using the system setup firmware program by adjusting the CPU Speed or Advanced Chipset Features properties. You can either increase the core clock speed (multiplier) or the FSB speed (overclocking the memory chips) or both. Increasing the clock speed requires more power and generates more heat. Therefore, an overclocked system must have a suitable power supply and sufficient cooling. The operating environment (the warmth of the room and build-up of dust) must also be quite carefully controlled.\n\nOverclocking is generally performed by hobbyists and games enthusiasts but it is also a means to build a PC more cheaply by specifying lower cost components, then boosting their performance.\n\nWithout cooling, overclocking increases the risk of thermal damage to components and may increase the frequency of system lockups. It also invalidates the warranty. Original Equipment Manufacturers (OEM) generally try to prevent overclocking in their PC systems by disabling custom settings in the computer's system setup program.\n\nA CPU may also run at a lower actual speed than it is capable of if it is put in a power saving mode.\ntag: C1 L4 TA

POWER MANAGEMENT (THROTTLING)\nRising energy costs and environmental legislation are placing power efficiency at the top of the agenda for IT buyers. In terms of CPU performance, more speed means greater power consumption and heat production. To deal with these issues, CPUs can implement power management to enter lower power states, referred to as throttling.\n\nAnother aspect of power management is protection for the CPU. If a processor runs too hot, the system can become unstable or damage can occur. CPUs provide routines to reduce performance to protect against overheating.\ntag: C1 L4 TA

OTHER CPU FEATURES\nTwo other features of modern CPUs need to be covered here. These support the use of virtualization and power-efficient graphics capability.\n\n• Virtualization extensions. Virtualization software allows a single computer to run multiple operating systems or Virtual Machines (VM). Intel's Virtualization Technology (VT) and AMD's AMD-V provide processor extensions to support virtualization, also referred to as hardware-assisted virtualization. This makes the VMs run much more quickly. These extensions are usually features of premium models in a given processor range.\n\nThere is also a second generation of virtualization extensions to support Second Level Address Translation (SLAT),  a feature of virtualization software designed to improve the management of virtual (paged) memory. These extensions are referred to as Extended Page Table (EPT) by Intel and Rapid Virtualization Indexing (RVI) by AMD.\n\n• Integrated GPU. Most computer systems provide some sort of built-in graphics adapter. Initially, an integrated GPU  would be implemented as part of the motherboard chipset; Intel's Graphics Media Accelerator, for instance. Nowadays, it is more likely that an integrated GPU, or Integrated Graphics Processor (IGP), will be part of the CPU (Intel HD Graphics, for example).\n\n(https://4sorcero.s3.amazonaws.com/byteback/core_1/fig_core_1_174.png)\nNVIDIA's control panel allows the system to select a graphics processor depending on application requirements.\n\nApart from cost, an IGP is more power-efficient than a dedicated card. Some laptop systems with both an IGP and a dedicated card are capable of switching automatically between them (NVIDIA Optimus and ATI Hybrid Graphics technologies), depending on whether an application requires advanced 3D performance or not, to conserve battery life.\ntag: C1 L4 TA

CPU PACKAGING AND COMPATIBILITY\nThere have been numerous CPU architectures, and within each architecture, a number of different models, and for each set of models, a brand to position them within a particular market segment. CPU packaging refers to the CPU's form factor and how it is connected to the motherboard. Intel and AMD use different socket types so you will never be able to install an AMD CPU in a motherboard designed for an Intel CPU (and vice versa). Additionally, within Intel's and AMD's own ranges, a given CPU socket type will only be compatible with a fairly limited number of CPU models.\n\nThe following tables summarize some of the various CPU models and socket types that have been used over the years. Note that the supported desktop processors and memory are illustrative rather than definitive. For more up-to-date information, visit a site such as CPU World, Tom's Hardware, or AnandTech.\n\n(https://4sorcero.s3.amazonaws.com/byteback/core_1/table_core_1_175.png)\n\nINTEL CPU RANGES AND SOCKET TYPES\nBrand Name: Description\n\nCore: This is Intel's flagship desktop and mobile CPU series. The earliest models (Core Solo and Core Duo) were laptop-only chips. The Core 2 series introduced desktop versions plus 64-bit and multicore support. The current range is divided into Core i3, i5, and i7 brands, with i7 representing the best performing models. The Core iX range has been based on successive generations of microarchitectures, named Nehalem, Sandy Bridge, Ivy Bridge, Haswell, Broadwell, and Skylake.\n\nPentium: The Pentium used to be Intel's premium 32-bit CPU brand and you may still find Pentium 4-based computers in use. The Pentium brand has been reintroduced to represent mid-range" CPU models based on the Core microarchitecture\n\nCeleron: This has long been Intel's budget brand.\n\nAtom: This brand designates chips designed for low-power portable devices (smartphones and tablets).\n\nXeon: This brand is aimed at the server/workstation market. Current Xeons are often differentiated from their Core counterparts by supporting n-way multiprocessing and ECC memory and coming with larger caches.\n\nIntel uses Land Grid Array(LGA) form factor CPUs. In LGA, the pins that connect the CPU and socket are located on the socket. This reduces the likelihood of damage to the CPU but increases the chance of damaging the motherboard\n\n(https://4sorcero.s3.amazonaws.com/byteback/core_1/fig_core_1_176.png)\nGIGA-BYTE Z97X Gaming motherboard with Intel Socket 1150. (Image © Gigabyte.)\n\nAMD CPU RANGES AND SOCKET TYPES\nOlder AMD brands such as Athlon™, Phenom™, Sempron™, and Turion™ have been phased out over the last few years. The following brands represent the company's Zen microarchitecture in different segments:\n• Ryzen™/Threadripper™ and Ryzen Mobile—this brand now represents AMD's pitch for the high-end enthusiast segment, replacing older AMD FX chips.\n• Epyc™—AMD's server-class CPU brand, replacing its long-standing Opteron series of chips.\n\nAMD uses Pin Grid Array (PGA) form factor chips, designed to fit in a Force Zero Insertion(ZIF) socket on the motherboard. As the name suggests, a PGA chip has a number of pins on the underside of the processor. These plug into corresponding holes in the socket. Care must be taken to orient the CPU correctly with the socket and to insert it so as not to bend or break any of the pins.\n\n(https://4sorcero.s3.amazonaws.com/byteback/core_1/fig_core_1_176.png)\nGIGA-BYTE motherboard with ZIF-type FM2+/FM2 socket for AMD CPUs.

COOLING MECHANISMS\nHeat is a by-product of pushing electric current through the various electronic components in the computer. The faster the components work, the more heat is produced. Excessive temperatures can cause the components to malfunction or even damage them. One of the most significant problems with CPUs (and graphics cards) is their thermal output. While Intel and AMD are both focusing on making new CPU designs more thermally efficient, all CPUs require cooling. Also, a specific CPU model requires a specific cooling system as some run hotter than others (later Pentium 4s being a good example).\n\nHEAT SINKS AND THERMAL PASTE\nA heat sink is a block of copper or aluminum with fins. As the fins expose a larger surface area to the air around the component, a greater cooling effect by convection is achieved. Before attaching the heat sink, dots of thermal paste (also referred to as thermal grease or thermal compound) should be applied to the surface of the CPU so that placing the heat sink spreads the paste into a thin layer. At the microscopic level, when two solids touch, there are actually air gaps between them that act as insulation; the liquid thermally conductive compound gel fills these gaps to permit a more efficient transference of heat from the processor to the heat sink.\n\nA heat sink is a passive cooling device. Passive cooling means that it does not require extra energy (electricity) to work. In order to work well, a heat sink requires good airflow around the PC. It is important to try to keep "cable clutter" to a minimum. There are various mechanisms for clamping a CPU heat sink to the motherboard. There may be a retaining clip or push pins. Push pins can be released and reset for insertion by making a half turn with a screwdriver.\n\n(https://4sorcero.s3.amazonaws.com/byteback/core_1/fig_core_1_178.png)\nCPU heatsink and fan assembly. Note: When purchasing a CPU, most CPU fans included alrady have thermal paste applied to the bottom of the CPU fan. If there is no thermal paste applied or the CPU didn't come with a CPU fan, then you'll need to purchase a separate tuble of thermal paste. (Image © 123RF.com.)\n\nFANS\nMany PCs have components that generate more heat than can be removed by passive cooling. A fan improves air flow and so helps to dissipate heat. Fans are used for the power supply and chassis exhaust points. The fan system will be designed to draw cool air from vents in the front of the case over the motherboard and expel warmed air from the back of the case.\n\nNote: A common implementation is to include air vents near the bottom of the front of the case and to place a fan near the top of the rear of the case to pull cooler air through the system.\n\nTypically, the speed of the fan is varied according to the temperature, and sensors are used to detect whether a fan has failed. Smaller fans may be used to improve the performance of the heat sink on the CPU, GPUs, and even hard disks.\n\nA fan is an active cooling device. It requires power to run.\n\nThe main problem with fans, especially at the lower end of the market, is that they generate noise. A fan also needs to be matched to the CPU model to ensure that it is powerful enough to cope with the processor's thermal output.\n\nMost CPU fans are designed to be removed without the use of tools. Usually the fan assembly will have clips and a power connector.\n\nSome chassis designs incorporate a plastic shroud or system of baffles to cover the CPU and channel the flow of air. The shroud is usually attached to the case using plastic clips.\n\nHEAT PIPES AND SPREADERS\nA heat pipe is a sealed tube containing some type of coolant (water or ethanol). The liquid close to the heat source evaporates then condenses at a cooler point in the pipe and flows back towards the heat source. The cool parts of the pipe are kept so by convection. This mechanism is more effective than a simple heat sink and fan assembly. It is necessary for a CPU that runs particularly hot or where there is not much space for airflow within the chassis. A dual heat pipe has two tubes, providing better cooling.\n\nA heat spreader uses the same design but is a flat container rather than a pipe. This design is better suited to portable computers. If used without fans, heat pipes and spreaders are classed as passive cooling.\n\nLIQUID-BASED COOLING SYSTEMS\nPCs used for high-end gaming (those with twin graphics cards, for instance) and with overclocked components may generate more heat than basic thermal management can cope with. PCs used where the ambient temperature is very high may also require exceptional cooling measures.\n\n(https://4sorcero.s3.amazonaws.com/byteback/core_1/fig_core_1_179.png)\nA liquid-cooled PC. (Image by Olivér Svéd © 123RF.com.)\n\nLiquid-based cooling refers to a system of pumping water around the chassis. Water is a much more effective coolant than air convection and a good pump can run more quietly than numerous fans. On the downside, liquid cooling makes maintenance and upgrades more difficult, requires comparatively more power to run, and is costly. Liquid cooling is an active cooling technology as the pump requires power to run.\ntag: C1 L4 TA

FANS AND POWER\nPower is supplied to a CPU or case fan by connecting its power connector to an appropriate header on the motherboard (make sure you plug the CPU fan into the header marked "CPU Fan" to ensure that the chipset can run the fan at an appropriate speed). Power connectors and headers for fans are 3-pin or 4-pin.\n• 3-pin models control fan speed by varying the voltage.\n• 4-pin models control fan speed by switching the voltage on and off (using a Pulse Width Module [PWM] signal carried by the fourth wire). This gives better control over fan speed.\n\nFans with a 3-pin connector can usually be used with 4-pin headers but the system may not be able to vary the fan speed (or may need special configuration to be able to do so). A fan with a 4-pin connector will usually work with a 3-pin header but will not be able to use PWM.\ntag: C1 L4 TA

CPU INSTALLATION CONSIDERATIONS\nBefore you replace a processor, you need to make sure you select a processor that matches the type of socket on the system board. Not all processors that use a particular socket will be compatible with your system; this is just one of several items you will need to check for compatibility. Also, when it comes to removing the CPU, there are several cooling device designs and socket types to deal with.\n\nIf you are upgrading the CPU, check that the new model is supported by the motherboard. Use the motherboard manufacturer's website to get up-to-date information (for example, to find out about CPU models that were released after the motherboard's documentation was written).\n\nNote: Just because a motherboard has the correct socket type does not mean that a CPU model will be compatible. The motherboard must have a compatible chipset and voltage regulators, too.\n\nPin 1 on the processor MUST match pin 1 on the processor socket. Both the processor and the socket carry distinguishing markings to indicate pin 1. On a processor, this may be:\n• A beveled corner or a white dot printed in one corner of the processor.\n• A square, rather than round, joint where one of the pins is connected to the underside of the processor.\n• A "spur" on one corner of the gold patch on the underside of the processor.\n\nOn a processor socket, this may be:\n• A difference in the pattern of pin holes in one corner.\n• A "1" printed on the motherboard next to one corner.\ntag: C1 L4 TA

Activity 4-1\nDiscussing CPU Upgrades\n\nSCENARIO\nAnswer the following questions to check your understanding of the topic.\n\nQuestion 1. What limits upgrade potential for the system processor?\n\nAnswer 1. The type of CPU socket and chipset provided on the motherboard.\n\nQuestion 2. How can CPU performance be improved?\n\nAnswer 2. Overclocking—setting the processor to run at a higher clock speed than it was designed for.\n\nQuestion 3. Why can cache improve performance?\n\nAnswer 3. A CPU tends to repeat the same routines and access the same data over-and-over again.  If these routines are stored in fast cache RAM, they can be accessed more quickly than instructions and data stored in system memory.\n\nQuestion 4. What does SMP mean?\n\nAanswer 4. Symmetric Multiprocessing—installing more than one CPU. This requires a motherboard with multiple CPU sockets.\n\nQuestion 5. How is the heat sink and fan assembly attached, and what problems can occur releasing it?\n\nAnswer 5. The heat sink is attached to the motherboard via a clip or push pins. There will also be a power connector for the fan. Clip mechanisms can be difficult to release; push pins are now more common and just require a half turn on each pin with a screwdriver to release. Another issue can arise where too much thermal paste has been applied, causing the heat sink to stick to the processor.\n\nQuestion 6. What must you check when inserting a PGA CPU chip?\n\nAnswer 6. That pin 1 is aligned properly and that the pins on the package are aligned with the holes in the socket. Otherwise, you risk damaging the pins when the ZIF lever is lowered.\n\nQuestion 7. What is the difference between a heat sink and a heat pipe?\n\nAnswer 7. A heat sink uses solid metal fins to dissipate heat through convection (often assisted by using fans to move air across the fins). A heat pipe contains fluid that evaporates in the area over the CPU, cools and condenses in a another part of the pipe, and then flows back to the area over the CPU to continue the cycle.\ntag: C1 L4 TA A4-1

Activity 4-2\nPlanning for a CPU Upgrade\n\nBEFORE YOU BEGIN\nYou will perform this activity at your WORKBENCH PC.\n\nSCENARIO\nYou want to upgrade the CPU in your home PC. You need to make sure that the CPU you are installing will perform better than the one currently installed, and that it will work with the existing motherboard and other components.\n\n1. Use the Windows System Properties page and find the CPUID CPU-Z utility to report system information and configuration.\na) Check System Properties to confirm the type of CPU currently installed.\nb) Run the CPUID CPU-Z utility using its desktop shortcut and click Yes when prompted by User Account Control (UAC).\nThe first tab shows information about the CPU.\n\n(https://4sorcero.s3.amazonaws.com/byteback/core_1/fig_core_1_182.png)\n\nc) Select the Caches tab. Cache helps the CPU "smooth" the flow of instructions fetched from system memory and make processing more efficient. Different CPU models come with different amounts of cache, arranged in levels. Level 1 cache is the fastest and usually the smallest.\n\n(https://4sorcero.s3.amazonaws.com/byteback/core_1/fig_core_1_183a.png)\n\nd) Select the Mainboard tab. This shows information about the motherboard and system firmware vendor and model.\n\n(https://4sorcero.s3.amazonaws.com/byteback/core_1/fig_core_1_183b.png)\n\n2. Determine which CPUs would provide better performance in the PC.\na) Using a vendor site such as http://processormatch.intel.com/, locate CPUs that are compatible with the motherboard and chipset.\nb) If available, review installation instructions for the replacement CPU.\ntag: C1 L4 TA A4-2

Topic B\nConfigure and Update BIOS/UEFI\n\nEXAM OBJECTIVES COVERED\n1001-3.5 Given a scenario, install and configure motherboards, CPUs, and add-on cards. In PC support, you will often need to use the system setup program to check or modify firmware settings and to perform firmware updates.\ntag: C1 L4 TB

SYSTEM FIRMWARE\nSystem Firmware straddles a gray area between hardware and software. Firmware is specialized software stored in memory chips that store information whether or not power to the computer is on. It is most often written on an electronically reprogrammable chip so that it can be updated with a special program to fix any errors that might be discovered after a computer is purchased, or to support updated hardware components.\n\nSystem firmware provides low-level code to allow the computer components to be initialized and load the main operating system software.\ntag: C1 L4 TB

BIOS\nFor many years, the system firmware for a PC was called the BIOS (Basic Input/Output System). BIOS provides the industry standard program code that initializes the essential components of the PC and ensures that the design of each manufacturer's motherboard is PC compatible.\ntag: C1 L4 TB

UEFI\nNewer motherboards may use a different kind of firmware called systems will have the Unified Extensible Firmware Interface (UEFI). UEFI provides support for 64-bit CPU operation at boot, a full GUI and mouse operation at boot, networking functionality at boot, and better boot security. A computer with UEFI may also support booting in a legacy BIOS mode.\ntag: C1 L4 TB

SYSTEM FIRMWARE SETUP PROGRAMS\nSystem settings can be configured via the system firmware setup program. This may also be referred to as CMOS setup, BIOS setup, or UEFI setup.\n\nNote: The term CMOS Setup is still widely used, even though the setup configuration is no longer stored within the CMOS RAM component.\n\nYou can normally access the system setup program with a keystroke during the power-on (boot) process. The key combination used will vary from system to system; typical examples are Esc, Del, F1, F2 or F12. The PC's documentation will explain how to Access the setup program; often a message with the required key is displayed when you boot the PC.\n\n(https://4sorcero.s3.amazonaws.com/byteback/core_1/fig_core_1_186a.png)\nBootup access to system firmware setup\n\nNote: One issue with modern computers is that the boot process can be very quick. If this is the case, you can Shift-click the Restart button from the Windows logon screen to access UEFI boot options. Alternatively, the motherboard vendor may supply a tool for disabling fast boot or accessing the setup program.\n\nYou navigate a legacy BIOS setup program using the keyboard arrow keys. Pressing Esc  generally returns to the previous screen. When closing setup, there will be an option to exit and discard changes or exit and save changes. Sometimes this is done with a key (Esc versus F10, for instance), but more often there is a prompt. There will also be an option for reloading the default settings, in case you want to discard any customizations you have made.\n\n(https://4sorcero.s3.amazonaws.com/byteback/core_1/fig_core_1_186b.png)\nA BIOS setup program\n\nUEFI setup programs might feature a graphical interface and mouse support.\n\n(https://4sorcero.s3.amazonaws.com/byteback/core_1/fig_core_1_187.png)\nA UEFI setup program.\ntag: C1 L4 TB

SYSTEM COMPONENT SETTINGS\nThe system firmware setup program will contain information about core components such as the CPU, chipset, RAM, hard drive(s), optical drive(s), and the battery (on a laptop).\n\nCPU FEATURES\nThere will be options for configuring features of the CPU, such as number of cores, cache, power performance, support for instruction set extensions that speed up virtualization (running multiple guest operating systems in a hypervisor), and so on. In most cases, these features will be detected and enabled by default. You may want to disable them to perform troubleshooting, however.\n\n(https://4sorcero.s3.amazonaws.com/byteback/core_1/fig_core_1_188a.png)\nCPU feature menu.\ntag: C1 L4 TB

RAM\nThe system software detects installed memory modules via a Serial Presence Detect (SPD) chip in the modules. The system software will allow you to enable or disable a boot-time memory check. There may also be options for configuring multi-channel memory modes. There may also be the option to overclock system memory modules. System memory properties and settings.\n\n(https://4sorcero.s3.amazonaws.com/byteback/core_1/fig_core_1_188b.png)\nSystem memory properties and settings.\ntag: C1 L4 TB

POWER MANAGEMENT\nPower management enables features such as soft power on/off (enabling the Windows Shut Down routine to power off the computer), power saving modes, hibernation, and so on. This option should normally be enabled.\n\n(https://4sorcero.s3.amazonaws.com/byteback/core_1/fig_core_1_189a.png)\nPower management profile configuration.\ntag: C1 L4 TB

DATE, TIME, AND DAYLIGHT SAVINGS\nSometimes known as the real time, this is simply the calendar date and time. The PC's Real Time Clock (RTC) can be automatically adjusted back or forward one hour as appropriate, within the time zone under Windows. If the real time clock starts to lose the correct date or time, the RTC battery could be failing.\ntag: C1 L4 TB

BOOT OPTIONS\nOne of the most important parameters in system setup is the boot sequence or boot device priority. This defines the sequence in which the system firmware searches devices for a boot manager. You will usually be able to set 3 or 4 options in priority order.\n\n(https://4sorcero.s3.amazonaws.com/byteback/core_1/fig_core_1_189b.png)\nBoot parameters.\n\nTypical choices include:\n•  Hard drive. A SATA boot disk should generally be connected to the lowest numbered port but it is usually possible to select the hard drive sequence if multiple fixed drives are installed.\n• Solid State Drive (SSD). An SSD attached using SATA will be listed with other SATA/ AHCI devices. An SSD installed as a PCIe Add-in Card (AIC) or on the M.2 interface can be used as a boot device if the firmware supports NVMe.\n• Optical drive (CD/DVD/Blu-ray). If you are performing a repair install, you might need to make this device highest priority.\n•  USB. Most modern systems can boot from USB drives.\n•  Network/PXE. Uses the network adapter to obtain boot settings from a specially configured server.\n\n(https://4sorcero.s3.amazonaws.com/byteback/core_1/fig_core_1_190.png)\nBoot order configuration.\ntag: C1 L4 TB

INTERFACE CONFIGURATION SETTINGS\nThere will be options for enabling/disabling and configuring any controllers and adapters provided on the motherboard. This will certainly include storage adapters and possibly features such as USB, network adapter, graphics adapter, and sound adapter.\n\n(https://4sorcero.s3.amazonaws.com/byteback/core_1/fig_core_1_191a.png)\nOnboard device configuration.\ntag: C1 L4 TB

SECURITY SETTINGS\nSeveral categories of security settings can be configured in system firmware setup programs.\n\nAUTHENTICATION\nDifferent system software will provide different support for authentication methods. There are usually at least two passwords, though some systems may allow for more:\n• Supervisor/Administrator/Setup—protect access to the system setup program.\n• User/System—lock access to the whole computer. This is a very secure way of protecting an entire PC as nothing can be done until the POST has taken place. The only real way of getting around this would be to open the PC and reset the system setup configuration, which isn't very easy to do.\n\n(https://4sorcero.s3.amazonaws.com/byteback/core_1/fig_core_1_191b.png)\nConfiguring system security.\n\nNote: For user/system authentication, you have to tell everyone who uses the PC the password, which weakens the security considerably. This option would be used only on workstations and servers that aren't used for interactive logon (a computer running monitoring or management software, for instance).\n\nDRIVE LOCKS\nThere are generally three options for securing access to the disk specifically (rather than the PC generally):\n• Configure and store the password in the PC firmware; this means that the disk is unusable except with the designated computer.\n• Store the password in the disk firmware; this is configured in conjunction with a compatible PC firmware and means that the disk is transferable between computers with a compatible firmware.\n• Use Full Disk Encryption (FDE) to encode the contents of the drive as well as password-protecting it. The selected password is used as the basis of the encryption key. Again, this requires a hard drive and firmware compatible with the same FDE product.\n\nNote: In most cases, there is some sort of recovery mechanism. This might involve the supervisor password or a password recovery disk.\n\nDRIVE ENCRYPTION\nDrive encryption means that the entire contents of the drive (or volume), including system files and folders, are encrypted. OS security measures are quite simple to circumvent if you can get hold of the drive itself. Drive encryption allays this security concern by making the contents of the drive accessible only in combination with the correct encryption key.\n\nWindows supports drive encryption in the BitLocker product, bundled with the Professional/Enterprise/Ultimate editions.\n\nNote: Third-party disk encryption products are available for other versions and editions of Windows.\n\nTPM\nBitLocker requires the secure storage of the key used to encrypt the drive contents. Normally, this is stored in a Trusted Platform Module (TPM) chip on the computer motherboard. TPM is a specification for hardware-based storage of digital certificates, keys, hashed passwords, and other user and platform identification information. Essentially, it functions as an embedded smart card. Each TPM microprocessor is hard-coded with a unique,  unchangeable key (the endorsement key). During the boot process, the TPM compares hashes of key system state data (system firmware, boot loader, and OS kernel) to ensure they have not been tampered with. The TPM chip has a secure storage area that a disk encryption program such as Windows BitLocker can write its keys to.\n\nIt is also possible to use a removable USB drive (if USB is a boot device option). As part of the setup process, you also create a recovery password or key. This can be used if the disk is moved to another computer or the TPM is damaged.\n\nNote: You may need to enable the TPM chip via the system setup before it can be used. Many vendors ship the computer with TPM disabled.\n\n(https://4sorcero.s3.amazonaws.com/byteback/core_1/fig_core_1_193.png)\nConfiguring a TPM\n\nLoJack\nSome laptop firmware is bundled with LoJack tracking software (developed by Absolute Software), essentially a security rootkit designed to prevent theft. If enabled (and the user has subscribed to LoJack ), a "dialer" is activated that attempts to contact Absolute Software's authorization servers each day. If the laptop is reported stolen, the authorization servers can force the laptop into a locked down mode (require a boot password or remotely wipe data, for instance). The software can also attempt to locate the laptop, either using GPS data if the laptop has a GPS chip or using information about nearby wireless networks. It can also try to identify the thief by installing forensic tools (a key logger and screen capture utility).\n\nINTRUSION DETECTION\nA computer chassis can be installed with sensors to report intrusion detection (if the chassis or lockable faceplate is opened) to management software or display an alert at boot time. Some setup programs can lock the workstation automatically if an intrusion is detected, requiring a supervisor to log on with the relevant password to unlock it again.\n\nSECURE BOOT\nSecure boot is a security system offered by UEFI. It is designed to prevent a computer from being hijacked by malware. Under secure boot, UEFI is configured with digital certificates from valid OS vendors. The system firmware checks the operating system boot loader using the stored certificate to ensure that it has been digitally signed by the OS vendor. This prevents a boot loader that has been modified by malware (or an OS installed without authorization) from being used.\n\nNote: Certificates from vendors such as Microsoft (Windows 8/10 and Windows Server 2012 and later) and Linux distributions (Fedora, openSUSE, and Ubuntu) will be pre-loaded. Additional certificates for other boot loaders can be installed (or the pre-loaded ones removed) via the system setup software. It is also possible to disable secure boot.\ntag: C1 L4 TB

FIRMWARE UPDATES\nSystem vendors and motherboard manufacturers may regularly update their system firmware in order to fix bugs, solve incompatibilities with operating systems, or to add new features. You should visit the relevant support website regularly to check whether upgrades are available. As upgrading the firmware is relatively risky (a failed motherboard update can leave the computer unbootable, for instance), it is only worth doing if the update fixes a specific problem that you are encountering or if it is regarded as a critical update.\n\nNote: Performing a firmware update is often referred to as "flashing."\ntag: C1 L4 TB

Activity 4-3\nDiscussing BIOS/UEFI Configuration and Updates\n\nSCENARIO\nAnswer the following questions to check your understanding of the topic.\n\nQuestion 1. What advantages does UEFI have over BIOS?\n\nAnswer 1. UEFI supports 64-bit CPU operation and better hardware support at boot. UEFI also allows for full GUI system utilities and mouse support plus better system startup security options (such as pre-OS boot authentication).\n\nQuestion 2. Name three keys commonly used to run a PC's BIOS/UEFI system setup program.\n\nAnswer 2. Esc, Del, F1, F2, F10.\n\nQuestion 3. What widely supported boot method is missing from the following list? HDD, FDD, Optical, USB.\n\nAnswer 3. Network/PXE (Pre-eXecution Environment)—obtaining boot information from a specially configured server over the network.\n\nQuestion 4. Where should you launch a typical firmware upgrade utility—from system  setup or from Windows?\n\nAnswer 4. If the option is available, it is safer to run a firmware upgrade from the system setup program as it reduces the risk of some other process interfering with the update.\n\nQuestion 5. If you want to enforce TPM system security, what other BIOS feature should you enable?\n\nAnswer 5. A supervisor password to prevent the TPM keys from being accessed or cleared.\n\nQuestion 6. True or false? Processor extensions such as VT are set by the vendor depending on the CPU model and cannot be enabled or disabled by the user.\n\nAnswer 6. Mostly false. A feature such as VT is sometimes disabled on some low-end models, but if it is available as a feature of that model, the user can choose whether it is enabled or disabled.\n\nQuestion 7. A user's computer was recently installed with a new optical drive. The user now reports a "chassis" error message after the POST sequence. What might be the cause?\n\nAnswer 7. Intrusion detection is enabled in the BIOS.\n\nQuestion 8. When you are configuring BIOS security, what is the difference between a supervisor password and a user password?\n\nAnswer 8. The user password allows the boot sequence to continue, while a supervisor password controls access to the firmware setup program.\n\nQuestion 9. What security system allows system boot to be disabled if the computer is reported stolen?\n\nAnswer 9. LoJack for Laptops (other tracking software suites are available).\ntag: C1 L4 TB A4-3

Topic C\nInstall Power Supplies\n\nEXAM OBJECTIVES COVERED\n1001-3.7 Summarize power supply types and features.\nIn this topic, you will take a closer look at the computer's power supply and its connections to the other system components. The computer's power supply is the main source of power for all components installed within the system unit. Understanding the power requirements of all the components and the maximum power supplied is crucial in managing the overall computer system power needs. Whether you are upgrading or replacing faulty components, you need to effectively manage the capacity of the current power supply.\ntag: C1 L4 TC

ELECTRICAL CIRCUITS\nElectricity is the flow of electrons through a conductor. The characteristics of the electricity supply are measured as voltage, current (amperage), resistance, and power.\n• Voltage—the potential difference between two points (often likened to pressure in a water pipe) measured in Volts (V).\n• Current—the actual flow of electrons, measured in Amps (I). A current flows in a circuit, which is made when conductors form a continuous path between the It's not necessary to go positive and negative terminals of a power source. The size of the current is determined by the conductivity of the circuit (for example, a higher current can flow in a thicker wire than can in a thinner one).\n• Resistance—a degree of opposition to the current caused by characteristics of the conductor, measured in Ohms (Ω or R).\n• Power—the rate at which electricity is drawn from the supply by the device using it, measured in Watts. Power is equal to the Voltage multiplied by the Current (W=V*I).\n• Energy—the amount of power consumed by a device over time. This is measured in Watt-hours (or more typically, Kilowatt-hours [kWh]).\n\nIn a Direct Current (DC) circuit, the charge flows in one direction from the positive to negative terminals of the power source at a constant voltage. DC is used for electronic circuits, which require stable voltages. Grid power is supplied as Alternating Current(AC) , which means that the current flows in both directions around the circuit and the voltage alternates between low and high values. AC is a cheap way to distribute electrical power over long distances, but is incompatible with PC electronics. Transformers in the PC's power supply are used to convert AC to DC voltages.\n\nIn the US, grid power is supplied at 120 VAC with a tolerance of ±5 percent, giving a range of 114 VAC to 126 VAC. Historically, US grid power has been supplied at 110 VAC and 115 VAC, and these values are still widely referred to. In continental Europe and Ireland, mains electricity is supplied at 220 VAC, while in the UK it is 240 VAC; however, there are tolerances that mean most devices designed for IT use in the European market can work with a supply of 220-240 VAC.\n\nHere are the electrical components used in a PC's electronic circuits:\n• Conductor —a material that is good at conducting electricity, such as gold, copper, or tin. These are used for wires and contacts.\n• Insulator —a material that does not conduct electricity, such as rubber or plastic. These are used as sheaths for wires to prevent short circuits or electric shocks.\n\nNote: Some materials are better conductors or insulators than others. Most materials have some degree of resistance, which creates heat as a current passes through it.\n\n• Semiconductor—a material that can act as both a conductor and an insulator. This provides switch-like functionality, where a circuit can be opened and closed, used to represent binary (on/off) digits.\n• Resistor —these oppose the flow of current without blocking it completely and are used to manage electronic circuits.\n• Diode —a valve, allowing current to flow in one direction only. These are used in a computer's power supply and as protection for components.\n• Fuse—this is a safety device. The flow of electricity creates heat. A fuse is designed so that if the current is too high, the heat will cause the fuse wire to melt and break, breaking the circuit and shutting off the current.\n• Transistor—in computers, these are semiconductor switches used to create logic devices. Typically, a type called a Field Effect Transistor (FET) is used to make components such as CPUs and memory.\n• Capacitor—this stores electrical energy and is often used to regulate voltages. Note that a capacitor can hold a charge after the power is removed.\ntag: C1 L4 TC

PSU\nThe Power Supply Unit (PSU) delivers Direct Current (DC) low voltage power to the PC components.\n\nThe PSU contains transformers (to step down to lower voltages), rectifiers (to convert AC to DC), and filters and regulators (to ensure a "clean" output or steady voltage). The other important component in the PSU is the fan, which dissipates the heat generated. Better quality models feature low noise fans.\n\nPSU FORM FACTORS\nThe power supply's size and shape (or form factor) determines its compatibility with the system case, in terms of available room plus screw and fan locations. The form factor also determines compatibility with the motherboard, in terms of power connectors.\n• Most PSUs are based on the ATX form factor. An ATX PSU should be 150 mm wide by 86 mm high by 140 mm deep. The "server-class" EPS12V specification allows PSUs to be 180 mm or 230 mm deep. These will usually fit ATX cases though obviously they protrude farther into the case so the available space should be measured first.\n• For Small Form Factor (SFF) PCs such as those based on the Micro-ATX motherboard form factor, an ATX PSU may fit. If the case is a slimline type, a smaller form factor may be required. Although there is no definition of a Micro-ATX PSU, the standards documentation refers to the following:\n• SFX12V—100 mm wide by 50 mm high by 125 mm deep with a 40 mm fan or 63.5 mm high with a 60 mm fan. There is an option to use a top-mounted 80 mm fan, making the unit 80 mm high.\n• TFX12V (Thin Form Factor)—this is narrower and longer compared to the "boxy" ATX and SFX formats. It measures 85 mm wide by 65 mm high by 175 mm deep. The part that fits the case slot is 61 mm high but there is a 4 mm bevel to accommodate the top-mounted fan.\n• SFF PSUs are rarely rated above 300 W. You can check formfactors.org for complete descriptions of the Intel specifications.\ntag: C1 L4 TC

INPUT VOLTAGE\nA PSU is plugged into an electrical outlet using a suitable power cable. The plug should always be fitted with a working fuse of the correct rating (typically 3 A or 5 A). The plug should suit the outlet type of the country you are in, though "travel plug" converters are commonly available.\n\nA critical point to recognize if you are taking a computer to a different country is to ensure that the PSU is set to the correct input voltage. A PSU designed only for use in North America, with an input voltage of 115 V, will not work in the UK, where the voltage is 240 V. Some PSUs are dual voltage and are auto-switching (or auto-sensing); some have a switch to select the correct voltage; others can only accept one type of input voltage (fixed).\n\nThe input operating voltages should be clearly marked on the unit and accompanying documentation.\n\n(https://4sorcero.s3.amazonaws.com/byteback/core_1/fig_core_1_199.png)\nAutoswitching PSU (left) and PSU with manual voltage selector (between the power points).\ntag: C1 L4 TC

PSU POWER RATINGS\nA PSU must be able to supply adequate power to all the PC's components. The maximum power output (power rating) available from a PC power supply is measured in watts, calculated as voltage multiplied by current (V*I). This can be referred to as the power rating or wattage rating.\n\nThe PSU found in a standard desktop PC is typically rated at around 200-300 W. This is normally sufficient for a full range of expansion cards and peripherals. Slimline desktop PCs may be fitted with 100-200 W power supplies. Tower systems and servers often have units rated over 300 W; enough to power many more disk drives, tape units, and other storage devices than would be fitted in a desktop PC. Gaming PCs might require 500 W or better power supplies to cope with the high specification CPU and graphics card(s).\n\nNote: The power requirement of different components varies widely (for example, CPUs can range from 17 W to over 100 W, depending on the model). If you are building or upgrading a system, the simplest way to work out the power requirement is to use an online calculator such as the one found at outervision.com.\ntag: C1 L4 TC

OUTPUT VOLTAGES\nWhen specifying a PSU for a system that needs a lot of power, it is also important to look closely at the power distribution of each unit. Power distribution refers to how much power is supplied over each rail. A rail is a wire providing current at a particular voltage.\n\n(https://4sorcero.s3.amazonaws.com/byteback/core_1/table_core_1_200.png)\n\nOutput Rail (V) Maximum Load (A) Maximum Output (W)\n+3.3 20 130\n+5 20 130\n+12 33 396\n-12 0.8 9.6\n+5 (standby) 2.5 12.5\n\nThe output of +3.3 V and +5 V has a combined limit. No combination of values actually adds up to 450 W, but PSU outputs are self-certified by the manufacturers, so this situation is not uncommon. For a modern computer, the output rating of the +12 V rail (or rails) is the most important factor, as +12 V is the most heavily used. A PSU with two +12 V rails can be referred to as dual rail. Each rail has a safety feature called (OCP) Overcurrent Protection , which cuts the circuit if the current exceeds a safe limit. Some PSU vendors prefer single +12 V rail designs while others use multi-rail designs, and it is one factor in determining overall PSU performance and safety. The internal design of the PSU has no effect on the way you make the connections to the motherboard.\n\nAlso note that peak output is only achieved under optimum conditions; sustained (or continuous) power output represents "real world" performance.\n\nThe power output is not the same as the power the PSU draws from grid power. If a PSU works at around 75% efficiency, a 300 W supply would draw 400 W from the outlet. The extra energy is lost mainly as heat.\n\nNote: As power becomes more expensive, power efficiency is an increasingly important criterion to use when selecting a PSU. An ENERGY STAR compliant PSU must be 80% efficient at 20-100% of load (many vendors only display the efficiency obtained under low load). 80 PLUS is a similar rating scheme.\ntag: C1 L4 TC

PSU ADAPTER TYPES\nThe power adapters supply various combinations of 3.3 V, 5 V, and 12 V positive and negative current. Not all components use power at precisely these voltages. PSU Adapter Types (3 on the motherboard are used to correct the voltage supplied from the PSU to the voltage required by the component.\n\nThe ATX PSU standard has gone through several revisions, specifying different adapter types.\n• P1 adapter. In the original ATX specification, the 20-pin P1 (2x10) adapter (also called the main connector) supplies power to the motherboard. Black wires are ground, yellow wires are +12 V, red wires are +5 V, and orange wires are +3.3 V. Most systems are now based on the ATX12V version 2 specification. This defines a 24-pin (2x12) P1 adapter to replace the 20-pin one. This is sometimes implemented as 20+4-pin P1 cable for compatibility with older ATX motherboards that have 20-types to provide pin adapters.\n\n(https://4sorcero.s3.amazonaws.com/byteback/core_1/fig_core_1_201a.png)\nA 24-pin main motherboard power cable and port. (Image by Olivér Svéd © 123RF.com.)\n\n• Molex and SATA connectors. The 4-pin (1x4) Molex connectors and 15-pin (1x15) SATA (Serial ATA) connectors supply +12 V and +5 V power for peripheral devices housed within the system case. The number of connectors determines the number and type of devices (such as hard drives and optical drives) that can be supported.\n\n(https://4sorcero.s3.amazonaws.com/byteback/core_1/fig_core_1_201b.png)\nFrom left to right: SATA and Molex power adapters. (Image by Olivér Svéd © 123RF.com.)\n\nNote: Modular PSUs have cables that are detachable from the PSU unit, allowing only the connectors actually required to be used. This reduces clutter within the chassis, improving air flow and cooling.\n\nIf there are insufficient adapters, it is possible to obtain splitters (also called y-adapters) so that two devices can be connected to the same cable. You can also obtain conversion adapters (Molex to SATA, for instance).\n• PCIe connectors. A 6-pin (2x3) connector is used to supply an extra 75 W power (+12 V) to PCIe graphics cards. This was updated to an 8-pin (2x4) connector delivering 150 W in the ATX12V v2.2 specification. Some adapters or dual-card systems will require the use of multiple PCIe auxiliary power connectors.\n\n(https://4sorcero.s3.amazonaws.com/byteback/core_1/fig_core_1_202a.png)\nA PCIe 6-pin power adapter. (Image © 123RF.com.)\n\nP4 and EPS 12V connectors. The ATX12V standard specifies an additional 4-pin (2x2) +12 V connector (often labeled P4) to support the operation of the CPU.\n\nYou may also come across 8-pin +12 V connectors. The Entry-level Power Supply (EPS) specification was developed initially for server-class hardware. Many of its features were incorporated in ATX12V. EPS12V defines an 8-pin +12 V connector. This is often wired as two 2x2-pin connectors so that an EPS12V PSU can be connected to an ATX motherboard with a 4-pin +12 V port.\n\n(https://4sorcero.s3.amazonaws.com/byteback/core_1/fig_core_1_202b.png)\nAn EPS 12V connector.

POWER NEEDS CALCULATION\nCalculating the amount of power needed for a PC helps ensure that you have enough power available for all the devices on the PC. The process is fairly simple:\n1. List the devices that need to have power served by the PSU. Be sure to include the following:\n• Motherboard\n• CPU\n• RAM\n• Hard drives\n• CD drives\n• DVD drives\n• Floppy drives (if any)\n• Expansion cards\n2. Determine the power requirements for each device.\n3. Add up the power requirements for the existing total power load.\n4. Consider adding a buffer of 20 to 30 percent for future power needs.\n5. Examine the details on the PSU currently installed, paying particular attention to the maximum output.\n• If you have not exceeded the power available, you do not need to upgrade the PSU.\n• If you have, you will need to obtain a PSU with a higher output and install it.\ntag: C1 L4 TC

Activity 4-4\nDiscussing Power Supply Installation\n\nSCENARIO\nAnswer the following questions to check your understanding of the topic.\n\nQuestion 1. How would you calculate the power used by a component?\n\nAnswer 1. Multiply its voltage by the current it draws (W=V*I).\n\nQuestion 2. What causes a fuse to blow—excessive voltage or excessive current?\n\nAnswer 2. Excess current.\n\nQuestion 3. What is the significance of a PSU's power output when you are designing a custom build PC?\n\nAnswer 3. It determines the number of drives, expansion cards, and peripherals that the PC can support (assuming the peripherals do not have their own power supplies).\n\nQuestion 4. Are you able to use a standard ATX12V PSU with a Mini-ITX motherboard?\n\nAnswer 4. Yes (assuming it fits in the case you have chosen).\n\nQuestion 5. You have a power supply with an 8-pin connector on it. What is this for?\n\nAnswer 5. It supplies power to a PCI Express graphics card.\n\nQuestion 6. You are connecting a new PSU. The PSU has a square 4-pin P4 cable but there is no square 4-pin receptacle on the motherboard. Should you leave the cable disconnected?\n\nAnswer 6. No; it will plug into an 8-pin EPS12V receptacle near the CPU. You should check the motherboard documentation for advice about which pins to plug the cable into.\n\nQuestion 7. What setting should you check before installing a PSU?\n\nAnswer 7. That the voltage selector is set to the correct voltage (or if there is no selector, that the PSU is suitable for the voltage used by the building power).\n\nQuestion 8. Another technician replaced the PSU on a PC. Later the same day the PC's owner contacts you to say that the system has been displaying numerous alerts about high temperature. What do you think might be the cause?\n\nAnswer 8. You would need to open the case to investigate the problem. Perhaps when the upgrade was performed, one of the fan power connectors was not attached properly. If the PSU cabling was not secured with cable ties, it could disrupt air flow within the case, reducing the effectiveness of fans.

Topic D\nTroubleshoot Internal System Components\n\nEXAM OBJECTIVES COVERED\n1001-5.2 Given a scenario, troubleshoot problems related to motherboards, RAM, CPUs, and power. As a CompTIA A+ technician, it is essential for you to be comfortable working with system components, whether you are installing them, configuring them, or trying to figure out how to resolve issues with them. It is only a matter of time before a personal computer's internal system hardware components experience problems, and generally these are problems users themselves cannot fix. As a CompTIA A+ technician, many of the service calls that you respond to will involve troubleshooting system hardware components, and your ability to quickly and effectively diagnose and solve the problems will be essential in maintaining the satisfaction level of the users you support.\ntag: C1 L4 TD

BASIC HARDWARE PROBLEMS\nWhen you are troubleshooting suspected problems, look for simple solutions first.\n• Find out if anything has changed.\n• Eliminate hardware issues as a cause first.\n• Try one thing at a time.\n• Take care to ensure that a user's data is backed up before proceeding.\nThere are several externally observable symptoms that may help you to diagnose a hardware problem without having to open the computer chassis.\ntag: C1 L4 TD

INDICATOR LIGHTS\nMost devices have a status Light Emitting Diode (LED) to indicate that the device is switched on and receiving power. Some devices may have additional status indicators or show other functions. For example, a hard drive LED shows activity; normally this should flicker periodically. If a hard drive LED is solid for extended periods it can indicate a problem, especially if the PC is not doing any obvious processing. Similarly, network adapters often have LEDs to indicate the connection speed and activity on the network.\ntag: C1 L4 TD

ALERTS\nMost PC systems now have quite good internal monitoring systems (such as the internal thermometers). When these systems detect problems, they can display an administrative alert, either on the local system or to some sort of network management system. The operating system may also be able to detect some kinds of hardware failure and display an appropriate alert.\ntag: C1 L4 TD

OVERHEATING\nExcessive heat damages the sensitive circuitry of a computer very easily. If a system feels hot to the touch you should check that the fans are operating and are not clogged by dirt or dust.\n\nNote: PCs and laptops can get very warm without there being a specific problem.\n\nAs mentioned above, many systems now come with internal temperature sensors that you can check via driver or management software. Use the vendor documentation to confirm that the system is operating within acceptable limits.\n\nUnusual odors, such as a burning smell, or smoke will almost always indicate something (probably the power supply) overheating. The system should be shut down immediately and the problem investigated.\n\nThermal problems are also likely to cause symptoms such as spontaneous reboots, blue screens, lockups, and so on. These will typically be cyclic—if you turn the system off and allow it to cool, the problem will only reappear once it has been running long enough for heat to build up again.\ntag: C1 L4 TD

LOUD NOISES\nDevices may also start to fail over time. Drives of most types are most prone to failure, but sensitive chips such as memory and graphics adapters can also develop problems (often caused by some underlying thermal issue).\n\nLoud or unusual noises can often indicate that a device such as a fan or hard drive is failing. Note that these may not be caused by hardware problems alone. For example, a fan that sounds noisy may be spinning too fast because its driver software is not controlling it properly.\n\nYou also need to be able to distinguish between "healthy" noises and "unhealthy" ones. For example, a hard disk may make a certain "whirring whine" when first spinning up and a "chattering" noise when data is being written, but clicking, squealing, loud noise, or continual noise can all indicate problems.\n\nNote: Newer and more expensive models make very little noise. There may also be a setting in system setup to optimize disk performance to reduce noise.\ntag: C1 L4 TD

VISIBLE DAMAGE\nIf a system has had liquid spilled on it or if fans or the keyboard are clogged by dust or dirt, there may be visible signs of this. Actual physical damage to a computer system is usually caused to peripherals, ports, and cables. Damage to other components is only really likely if the unit has been in transit somewhere. Inspect a unit closely for damage to the case; even a small crack or dent may indicate a fall or knock that could have caused worse damage to the internal components than is obvious from outside.\n\nIf a peripheral device does not work, examine the port and the end of the cable closely for bent, broken, or dirty pins and connectors. Examine the length of the cable for damage.\ntag: C1 L4 TD

POWER PROBLEMS\nPC components need a constant, stable supply of power to run. If the computer will not start, it is likely to be due to a power problem. If the PC suddenly turns off or restarts, power problems are also likely.\n\nIn the normal course of operations, the PSU converts the AC mains supply to DC voltages. DC voltage is used to power the internal drives and motherboard components. The PSU continually draws standby power from the mains (unless the PSU has its own on/off switch and it has been switched off). When the PC is switched on, the PSU starts supplying 12 V power and fans and disks should spin up. The PSU tests its 5 V and 3.3 V supplies, and when it is sure that it is providing a stable supply, it sends a "Power Good" signal to the processor.\n\nThe processor then begins to run the Power On Self-Test (POST) program. POST will not run without a CPU. Some motherboards may be able to sound an alert or light a status LED if the CPU is not present or not working. If none of the LEDs on the front panel of the system case are lit up and you cannot hear the fans or hard drives spinning, the computer is not getting power. This is likely to be a fault in the PSU, incoming mains electricity supply, power cables/connectors, or fuses.\n\nTo isolate the cause of no power, try the following tests:\n• Check that other equipment in the area is working; there may be a blackout.\n• Check that the PSU cabling is connected to the PC and the wall socket correctly and that all switches are in the "on" position.\n• Try another power cable—there may be a problem with the plug or fuse. Check that all of the wires are connected to the correct terminals in the plug. Check the fuse resistance with a multimeter.\n• Try plugging another piece of "known-good" equipment (such as a lamp) into the wall socket. If it does not work, the wall socket is faulty. Use another socket and get an electrician to investigate the fault.\n• Try disconnecting extra devices, such as optical drives. If this solves the problem, the PSU is underpowered and you need to fit one with a higher power rating.\ntag: C1 L4 TD

MULTIMETER USE\nA multimeter can be used to measure voltage, current, and resistance. Voltage readings can be used to determine whether, for example, a power supply unit is functioning correctly. Resistance readings can be used to determine whether a fuse or network cable is functioning correctly.\n• To test a fuse, set the multimeter to measure resistance and touch the probes to each end of the fuse. A good fuse should have virtually zero Ohms of resistance; a blown fuse will have virtually infinite resistance.\n• Power supply problems can be indicated by otherwise inexplicable system lockups or unprompted reboots.\n\nCaution: PC power supplies are NOT user-serviceable. Do NOT attempt any maintenance beyond the simple tests described. Never remove the cover of a power supply.\n\n• When you measure the voltage for each pin in a connector, be aware that a degree of tolerance is allowed:\n\n(https://4sorcero.s3.amazonaws.com/byteback/core_1/table_core_1_210.png)\n(https://4sorcero.s3.amazonaws.com/byteback/core_1/table_core_1_211.png)\n                                       \nSupply Line   Color Code   Tolerance   Minimum Voltage    Maximum Voltage\n+5 V            Red         ±5%         +4.75 V  +5.25 V\n+12 V         Yellow         ±5%       +11.4 V   +12.6 V\n-12 V          Blue         ±10%        -10.8 V  -13.2 V\n+3.3 V         Orange       ±5%         +3.135 V  +3.465 V\n+5 V Standby   Purple       ±5%         +4.75 V   +5.25 \nPSU On         Green    Higher than +3 V when PC is off; less than 0.9 V when the PC is on.\nPower Good     Gray      Less than 0.9 V when the PC is off; higher than 2.5 V when the PC is on.\nGround Black - - \n\n(https://4sorcero.s3.amazonaws.com/byteback/core_1/fig_core_1_211.png)\nTesting a Molex connector with a multimeter\n\nIf it seems that the PSU voltages are correct and that all power connectors are properly in place, then there may be a fault or overload on one of the peripheral devices (for example, the optical drive or the hard disk). Remove one peripheral device at a time (turn OFF when removing and reconnecting devices) to confirm whether the fault lies with one of these units. If you still cannot identify the fault, then the problem is likely to be a faulty motherboard or adapter card.\n\nIf you suspect that a power supply is faulty, do not leave it turned on for longer than absolutely necessary and do not leave it unattended. Keep an eye out for external signs of a problem (for example, smoke or fire). Turn off immediately if there are any unusual sights, smells, or noises.\n\nNote: It is usually easier (and safer) to test the power supply by substitution (install a known good PSU) than to test with a multimeter.\ntag: C1 L4 TD

POWER SUPPLY TESTER\nA Power Supply Tester is a device designed (unsurprisingly) with the sole purpose of testing PSUs. It is much simpler to use than a multimeter as you do not have to test each pin in turn.\n\n(https://4sorcero.s3.amazonaws.com/byteback/core_1/fig_core_1_212.png)\nTechnician working with a power supply tester. (Image by Konstantin Malkov © 123RF.com.)\n\nTypical models come with ports for the 20/24-pin P1, Molex, SATA, plus 8-pin, 6-pin, and 4-pin connectors found on different models of PSU. Usually each pin on each port has an LED to indicate whether the voltage supplied is good or (in more advanced models) a reading of the voltage supplied.\ntag: C1 L4 TD

POST AND BOOT PROBLEMS\nOnce the CPU has been given the power good signal, the system firmware performs the Power On Self Test (POST). The POST is a built-in diagnostic program that checks the hardware to ensure the components required to boot the PC are present and functioning correctly. This is the general process for the POST:\n1. The POST starts by locating video card firmware at the address C000 in memory. If found, the video card is initialized from its own firmware. Information from the card manufacturer may also be displayed at this point.\n2. A startup screen is displayed. More tests on the system, including counting through system RAM, are performed. If any errors are found, a text error message is displayed. Explanations of these messages are usually found in the system guide. Once numeric codes, these messages now tend to be descriptive, such as key stuck."\n3. You should be able to access the system setup routine from this point. This allows you to reconfigure the settings stored in system setup. The key used to invoke system setup varies according to the firmware, but is usually Delete, F2, Esc, F10 or F1\n4. Some PCs indicate that system checks have been successfully completed at this point with a single short beep, but the trend for modern computers is to boot silently.\n5. A search is made for further interfaces that may have firmware chips on them. This could include storage adapters and network cards. Further information about these cards may be displayed at this point and their memory addresses reserved.\n6. The firmware may display a summary screen about the system configuration. This may scroll by quite quickly. Use the Pause key if you want to analyze it.\n7. The operating system load sequence starts.\n\nNote: On modern computers, the POST happens very quickly to improve boot times so you are unlikely to see any POST messages. A modern POST is unlikely to perform thorough checks such as a memory count.\ntag: C1 L4 TD

POST NOT RUNNING\nIf power is present (for example, if you can hear the fans spinning) but the computer does not start or the screen is blank and there are no beeps from the speaker, it is likely that the POST procedure is not executing.\n\nIf the screen is blank, check that the monitor cable is connected and undamaged and that the monitor is powered on. If the monitor has separate inputs (for example, HDMI and DVI), make sure it is switched to the correct one. If possible, test with another monitor to confirm that there is no problem with the display. If you can rule out a problem with the display itself, other likely causes are faulty cabling or a damaged or mis-seated CPU or other motherboard component. To troubleshoot, try the following tests and solutions:\n• Ask what has changed—if the system firmware has been flashed and the PC has not booted since, the system firmware update may have failed. Use the reset procedure.\n• Check cabling and connections, especially if maintenance work has just been performed on the PC. An incorrectly oriented storage adapter cable or a badly seated adapter card can stop the POST from running. Correct any errors, reset adapter cards, and then reboot the PC.\n• Check for faulty interfaces and devices—it is possible that a faulty adapter card or device is halting the POST. Try removing one device at a time to see if this solves the problem (or remove all non-essential devices then add them back one-by-one).\n• Check the PSU—even though the fans are receiving power, there may be a fault that is preventing the Power Good signal from being sent to the CPU, preventing POST.\n• Check for a faulty CPU or system firmware. If possible, replace the CPU chip with a known good one or update the system firmware.\n• Some motherboards have jumpers to configure modes (such as firmware recovery) or processor settings. If the jumpers are set incorrectly it could cause the computer not to boot. If a computer will not work after being serviced, check that the jumpers have not been changed.\n\nNote: Remember to ask "What has changed" when troubleshooting. For example, it is best practice to check that a system works properly after performing any sort of servicing work (such as updating the firmware) but not all technicians are so diligent. If a user complains that their previously working PC will not boot, find out what happened to it in the intervening period.\ntag: C1 L4 TD

POST BEEP CODES\nIf POST detects a problem, it generates an error message. As the error may prevent the computer from displaying anything on the screen, the error is often indicated by a series of beeps.\n\nFor a beep code, you must decode the pattern of beeps and take the appropriate action. Use resources such as the manufacturer's website to determine the meaning of codes. Examples of manufacturer websites include ami.com, phoenix.com (Award), compaq.com dell.com  and dell.com. Websites such as bioscentral.com provide a good summary and can be located easily through Internet search engines.\n\nThe codes for the original IBM PC are listed in this table.\n\n(https://4sorcero.s3.amazonaws.com/byteback/core_1/table_core_1_214.png)\n\nCode                         Meaning\n1 short beep               Normal POST—system is OK.\n2 short beeps              POST error—error code shown on screen.\nNo beep                    Power supply or motherboard problem (use a multimeter to check the onboard speaker is functioning).\nContinuous beep            Power supply, motherboard, or system memory problem.\nRepeating short beeps      Power supply, motherboard, or keyboard problem.\n1 long, 1 short beep       Motherboard problem.\n1 long, 2 or 3 short beeps Display adapter error.\n3 long beeps               3270 keyboard card.\n\nError messages on the screen are usually descriptive of the problem. In each case, take the appropriate action.\n\nNote: If the screen is blank on bootup but you hear a single beep, check the monitor is turned on and connected properly. Try testing the monitor with a different computer. If the monitor is OK, try replacing the graphics adapter.\ntag: C1 L4 TD

BIOS TIME AND SETTINGS RESET\nWhile modern computers do not rely on the CMOS battery to store system settings, if the computer is losing the correct time, it can be a sign that the Real Time Clock battery is failing. On older computers, the failure of the battery may lead to system setup settings being lost or corrupted. You may see a "CMOS Checksum" error or similar. To replace the CMOS battery:\n1. Obtain a coin cell battery that is compatible with your motherboard.\n2. Unclip the existing battery and take it out.\n3. Plug in the new battery.\n4. Switch the computer back on.\ntag: C1 L4 TD

OPERATING SYSTEM SEARCH/BOOTS TO INCORRECT DEVICE\nOnce the POST tests are complete, the firmware searches the devices as specified in the boot sequence. If the first drive in the sequence is not found, it then moves on to the next. For example, if there is no fixed disk, the boot sequence checks for a USB-attached drive.  If no disk-based boot device is found, the system might attempt to boot from the network. If no boot device is found, the system displays an error message and halts the boot process.\n\nIf the system attempts to boot to an incorrect device, check that the removable drives do not contain media that are interfering with the boot process and that the boot device order is correctly configured.\ntag: C1 L4 TD

OS BOOT TROUBLESHOOTING AND LOG ENTRIES\nIf a boot device is located, the code from the boot sector on the selected device is loaded into memory and takes over from the system firmware. The boot sector code loads the rest of the operating system files into system memory. Error messages received after this point can usually be attributed to software (or driver) problems rather than issues with hardware devices.\n\n(https://4sorcero.s3.amazonaws.com/byteback/core_1/fig_core_1_215.png)\nViewing startup messages on a Linux server\n\nNote: In Windows 7, you can use the Startup Configuration utility (msconfig) to show boot messages (select OS boot information on the Boot tab). In Windows 10, this setting does not work and you need to enable verbose boot messages via the registry.\n\nIf no error message is displayed at startup, issues with the operating system can often be diagnosed by checking for log entries.\n• In Windows, boot messages are written to the C:\\Windows\\ntbtlog.txt file. You should also use Event Viewer to analyze the System and Application logs for any errors.\n• In Linux, you can review the boot messages using the dmesg | less command.\ntag: C1 L4 TD

MOTHERBOARD COMPONENT PROBLEMS\nFew problems are actually caused by the motherboard itself, but there are a few things to be aware of.\n• The motherboard does contain soldered chips and components, which could be damaged by Electrostatic Discharge (ESD), electrical spikes, or overheating.\n• The pins on integrated connectors can also be damaged by careless insertion of plugs.\n• In some cases, errors may be caused by dirt (clean the contacts on connectors) or chip creep, where an adapter works loose from its socket over time, perhaps because of temperature changes.\n\nNote: Remember to ask "What has changed?" Check job logs to find out whether any maintenance or upgrades were carried out recently.\n\n• Unstable operation. Symptoms of intermittent device failure such as the system locking up, unexpected shutdown, displaying a Blue Screen of Death (BSoD) crash screen, or continuous rebooting are difficult to diagnose with a specific cause, especially if you are not able to witness the events directly. The most likely causes are software, disk problems, or malware.\n\nNote: A blue screen is a system crash screen proprietary to Windows. A macOS system that suffers catastrophic process failure shows a spinning pinwheel (of death), also called a spinning wait cursor.\n\nIf you can discount these, try to establish whether the problem is truly intermittent or whether there is a pattern to the errors. If they occur when the PC has been running for some time, it could be a thermal problem.\n\nNext, check that the power supply is providing good, stable voltages to the system. If you can discount the power supply, you must start to suspect a problem with memory, CPU, or motherboard.\n\n•  Visual inspection. Inspect the motherboard for any sign of damage. If a component has "blown" it can leave scorch marks. You could also look for distended capacitors. The capacitors are barrel-like components that regulate the flow of electricity to the system chips. If they are swollen or bulging or emitting any kind of residue they could have been damaged or could have failed due to a manufacturing defect.\n\nIf there is physical damage to the motherboard you will almost certainly need diagnostic software to run tests to confirm whether there is a problem. Testing by substituting "known good" components would be too time consuming and expensive. The most likely causes of physical damage are heat, ESD, or a power surge or spike. It is worth investigating any environmental problems or maintenance procedures that could be the "root cause" of the error.\n\n(https://4sorcero.s3.amazonaws.com/byteback/core_1/fig_core_1_216.png)\nMotherboard CPU socket and heatsinks surrounfed by healthy capacitors. (Image © 123RF.com.)\n \n• Overheating. Insufficient cooling is the main cause of processor, memory, and motherboard problems. Thermal faults are normally cyclic: a system works for some time, crashes, and then works again later because powering down allows the processor to cool. To check for overheating issues:\n• Ensure that the CPU fan is working. Proper cooling is vital to the lifespan and performance of the processor. If the processor is running too hot, it can decrease performance. A processor that is overheating can cause crashes or reboot the machine.\n\nIs the fan's power cable properly connected? Is the fan jammed, clogged, or too small? If a processor upgrade is installed, the fan from the original CPU may not be suitable for the new device.\n\nNote: Pro-actively optimize the existing cooling system by clearing dust from chips, heat sinks, and fans. Also verify that there is sufficient space around the PC's vents to allow for adequate air flow. If the PC is positioned too closely to a wall, it might prevent effective cooling.\n\n• Make sure the heatsink is properly fitted. It should be snug against the processor. Heatsinks are usually "stuck" to the processor using a special heat conductive paste. Some manufacturers use lower quality paste. In these cases, it is possible to clean away the old paste and replace it with better paste, which will help the processor to run at a lower temperature.\n• Always use blanking plates to cover up holes in the back or front of the PC. Holes can disrupt the airflow and decrease the effectiveness of the cooling systems.\n• Speed—is the processor running at the correct speed? Running a processor at a higher clock speed can cause overheating. Double-check the voltage and timing settings in CMOS Setup.\n• Environment—is the room unusually warm or dusty or is the PC positioned near a radiator or in direct sunlight? Thermal problems may also affect system operation by causing loose connectors to drift apart, components to move in their sockets, or circuit board defects such as hairline cracks to widen and break connections. Some of these faults can be detected by visual inspection.\n\nNote: CPUs and other system components heat up while running. Take care not to burn yourself when handling internal components.\ntag: C1 L4 TD

Activity 4-6\nDiscussing System Component Troubleshooting\n\nSCENARIO\nAnswer the following questions to check your understanding of the topic.\n\nQuestion 1. What cause might you suspect if a PC experiences intermittent lockups?\n\nAnswer 1. Assuming the cause is not recent installation of faulty software or hardware, then thermal or power problems are most likely. Loose connections or faulty memory or CPU are also possibilities.\n\nQuestion 2. How might you diagnose a thermal problem?\n\nAnswer 2. Feel if the system is hot to touch, check temperature gauges, watch for cyclic lockup/reboot problems.\n\nQuestion 3. What measurement would you expect from a multimeter if a fuse is good?\n\nAnswer 4. Zero ohms.\n\nQuestion 4. What might stop a POST from executing?\n\nAnswer 4. Faulty cabling and connections, poorly-seated chips, faulty interfaces and devices, logic errors, faulty CPU, motherboard, or PSU.\ntag: C1 L4 TD A4-6

Activity 4-7\nDiagnosing Power Problems\n\nBEFORE YOU BEGIN\nYour instructor will provide you with a multimeter or power supply tester to use to test the output voltages from the PSU. This involves working with a live system. Follow the instructions carefully and do not touch parts of the computer when it is switched on.\n\nYou will perform this activity at your WORKBENCH PC.\n\nSCENARIO\nYou have been assigned several power problems to solve.\n\nQuestion 1. Problem #1 When the user turns on the PC, it does not always come on and sometimes it just shuts itself down abruptly, with no warning. When she turns on the system again, there is no fan noise. She is using a legacy database application and the data is being corrupted during the improper shutdowns.\n\nWhat would you do to resolve this problem?\n\nAnswer 1. Unplug the power cord. Remove the system cover. Using compressed air, remove the dust from around the fan spindle. Verify that there is no obvious reason the fan is not spinning. Replace the power cord and restart the computer. Verify that the computer starts properly. If these actions did not fix the problem, you would need to replace the power supply. Leaving the problem alone would allow heat to build up to dangerous levels, causing serious damage to the system.\n\nQuestion 2. Problem #2 A user is reporting an odor coming out of his computer. You have serviced this machine recently and replaced the computer's power supply unit. What would you do to resolve this problem?\n\nAnswer 2. An odor coming from the power supply could be a sign that there is something wrong. Because you have just replaced the unit, verify that all the connections are secure and that the fan is functioning. Restart the machine and verify that the power supply is running as it should. Once the functionality of the unit is verified, then odor is probably a result of installing a new power supply unit. If the odor does not go away in a few days, then contact the power supply manufacturer.\n\nQuestion 3. Problem #3 One of the other hardware technicians has been trying to troubleshoot a power problem. The system will not come on when the user turns on the power switch. He determined that the user has an ATX motherboard and power supply. You have been assigned to take over this trouble ticket.\na) You will be using a multimeter to measure 5 and 12 Volts DC. Set your multimeter accordingly and attach its probes if required.\nb) Remove the PC from the electrical supply, then remove the case cover.\nc) Find a spare Molex connector, or remove a Molex connector from a optical drive or hard disk drive.\nd) Insert the black (REF) probe into a black cable connector and the other probe into the yellow cable connector in the Molex.\ne) Turn on your multimeter.\nf) Reconnect the power cord to your PC and to building power, and turn it on.\ng) Take a reading and record the results here.\nh) Turn off your PC and repeat the above process for the red cable and write the result and resolve the issue.\ni) Are these recordings acceptable?\n\nQuestion 4. Problem #4\nThe user turns on the power switch, but the PC does not come on. He does not hear the fan, there is no power light on, and he hears no beeps or other sounds coming from the system. His system is plugged into a surge protector. What would you do to resolve this problem?\n\nAnswer 4. Verify that the power cord is securely connected to the power supply and to the electrical outlet on the surge protector. Verify that the surge protector is turned on and plugged in. Verify that the surge protector is working by plugging in a known good electrical device and turning it on. If the device did not turn on, check to see whether any reset buttons need to be reset on the surge protector, or check the electric outlet's circuit breaker. Restart the computer. If these actions did not solve the problem, you would need to replace the power supply.\n\nQuestion 5. You also need to perform some routine testing of safety equipment. Using your multimeter, measure the resistance of your ESD kit's wrist strap cable, connecting the crocodile clip to the black probe and touching the red probe to the metal plate that makes contact with your skin. Why is it so high?\n\nAnswer 5. A wrist strap must allow high voltage charges to leak from your body and clothing through the ground, but prevent large currents from flowing into your body and causing an electric shock. This is accomplished by a megaohm resistor.\n\nQuestion 6. Using your multimeter, measure the resistance of a fuse—your instructor will provide you with these. What does it mean if the reading is zero or over range?\n\nAnswer 6. The fuse has blown and must be replaced.\ntag: C1 L4 TD A4-7

Activity 4-8\nDiagnosing System Errors\n\nBEFORE YOU BEGIN\nYou will perform this activity at your WORKBENCH PC.\n\nSCENARIO\nYou are attempting to resolve problems for a user who has been reporting intermittent but severe system errors, such as frequent unexpected shutdowns. The problems have been getting more frequent, and you have been unable to pinpoint a cause within the system software, power supply, memory, or any adapter cards. You are starting to suspect that there is a bad CPU, and you need to proceed accordingly to get the user back to work with as little downtime and cost as possible.\n\nQuestion 1. What initial steps should you take to identify and resolve a potential CPU\nproblem?\n☐ Replace the CPU with a known-good processor.\n☑ Verify that the CPU fan and other cooling systems are installed and functional.\n☐ Replace the motherboard.\n☑ If the CPU is overclocked, throttle it down to the manufacturer-rated clock speed.\n\nQuestion 2. All other diagnostic and corrective steps have failed. You need to verify that\nit is the CPU itself that is defective. What should you do?\n Replace the CPU with a known-good chip.\n Remove all the adapter cards.\n Reinstall the operating system.\n Replace the motherboard.\n\nQuestion 3. A colleague suggests that you might want to view the symptoms of some different\nsystem errors. For each following components:\n1. Prepare to work inside the computer case.\n2.

Disconnect the hard disk drive from the motherboard. What happens?\n\nQuestion 6. Rearrange the memory cards by putting them in different slots or removing one of them. What happens?\n\nQuestion 7. Your instructor will now create a problem on your PC. Use your troubleshooting skills to try and solve it. Record what you found during the troubleshooting process.\ntag: C1 L4 TD A4-8

Topic E\nConfigure a Custom PC\n\nEXAM OBJECTIVES COVERED\n1001-3.8 Given a scenario, select and configure appropriate components for a custom PC configuration to meet customer specifications or needs. 1001-3.9 Given a scenario, install and configure common devices.\n\nAs a CompTIA A+ technician, you must be knowledgeable in many different areas of information technology. This may include supporting a wide variety of client configurations, such as gaming or audio and video workstations. You must be prepared to fully support any type of environment, including more specialized hardware and software configurations based on job roles and tasks.\ntag: C1 L4 TE

CLIENT PERSONAL COMPUTERS\nWhen installing and configuring user workstations, it is important to identify what the specific needs are of the user that will be using the workstation to perform job tasks. Standard clients are a good starting point for any installation and must be examined to verify that they fit the requirements of the job function.\n\nStandard business client computers are end-user computers that are administered and managed centrally by a server.\n\nYou might be called on to set up or service any of the following client types:\n\n•  A Standard (thick) clients. (sometimes referred to as thick client to distinguish it from a thin client) is an ordinary office PC. It will be used to run locally installed desktop applications, such as office productivity (word processor, spreadsheet, and presentation) plus Line of Business software, email/calendaring/ contact management, and a web browser.\n\nWhen you are configuring a standard client, it is important to pay attention to the Windows or Linux system requirements and to the software application requirements. Using the minimum OS requirements is likely to lead to poor performance.\n\nA standard client might be configured with multiple user accounts. These user accounts might be defined locally on each computer (a workgroup) or on a network directory server (a domain). Windows 10 also supports the use of Microsoft accounts, which use cloud services to synchronize settings and data across each of the Windows-based devices that a user signs in to. Each standard user account is allocated its own private data storage folders. Each account can be configured with different desktop settings and (if applicable) network permissions and privileges.\n\nIf data is stored locally, then access to storage locations is required with a consistent pathway to data. Similarly, if data is stored on a network, then a consistent path should be established to the storage location with proper security implementations.\n\n•  Thin clients. A thin client is a PC or appliance designed to act as an interface to applications that run on a network server. The client may be interfacing with course. particular software applications or with an entire Windows Desktop. This is referred to as Virtual Desktop Infrastructure (VDI). In this scenario, the only really important performance criteria for the thin client is the network link. The client PC does no application processing. It just transfers mouse and keyboard input to the server and processes video and audio output coming back. The applications do not get installed on the computer and do not use up any hard drive space. RAM is used to run the application from the server.\n\nNote: Virtualization is covered in greater detail later in the course.\n\nThe client may be interfacing with particular software applications or with an entire Windows or Linux desktop. The client will have to meet the minimum requirements for installing the selected OS, but that is all. The computer might require specialized software in order to access the applications hosted by the server. The computer may also require a specific browser or browser version in order to run any web-based applications.\n\nNote: Microsoft has a Thin Client version of Windows 7 but its minimum spec is actually the same as any other Windows 7 edition. It's worth noting that Microsoft stopped distinguishing between "minimum" and "recommended" system requirements.\n\nWhen the thin client starts, it boots a minimal OS, allowing the user to log on to a Virtual Machine (VM) stored on the company server infrastructure. The user makes a connection to the VM using some sort of remote desktop protocol (Microsoft Remote Desktop or Citrix ICA, for instance). The thin client has to find the correct image and use an appropriate authentication mechanism. There may be a 1:1 mapping based on machine name or IP address or the process of finding an image may be handled by a connection broker. Consequently, to configure a thin client you need only install the thin client OS and configure the connection manager/broker. User accounts are created on the server rather than directly on the thin client itself.\ntag: C1 L4 TE

BUSINESS WORKSTATIONS\nThe term workstation is sometimes used to describe a computer that runs more demanding applications than standard office suites. These systems typically have faster processors, more memory, and faster and larger drives than standard desktop systems.\n\nMost computers deployed for business use will fit one of the following profiles.\n\n•  Programming, development, and virtualization workstations. A workstation used to develop software or games will run one or more Environments (IDEs). It may also run a local database server application for testing. Consequently, these workstations require fast CPUs and mass storage access, plus plenty of system memory.\n\nDevelopment work is also likely to require virtualization, so that the developer has access to multiple operating system environments for testing. Virtualization requires a lot of system memory. Each guest OS would typically need at least 1—2 GB even for average performance. It also benefits from multiple CPU cores and multi-channel memory as well as a large, fast disk subsystem.\n\n• Graphics and CAD/CAM design workstations. Media design workstations are configured to support the needs of graphic designers, engineers, architects, 3D media developers, and other design-driven job roles. A workstation used for different types of design will have to support applications with high CPU, GPU, and memory requirements. Such workstations also need a fast storage subsystem and are typically provisioned with Solid State Drives (SSDs), rather than older hard disks.\n\nTypical design applications include:\n• Image editing and illustration tools.\n• Desktop Publishing (DTP)and web design.\n• Computer Aided Design (CAD).\n• Computer Aided Manufacturing (CAM).\n\nNote: CAM workstations can control machine tools found in manufacturing environments. Specialized controller cards may be required as well as specialized connections and software. CAM machines may be installed in harsh environments —such as manufacturing buildings and automotive factories—so the workstations may need to be hardened machines that will not be adversely affected by their working environments.\n\nDesign work will also often require specialist peripherals, such as a digitizer and styluses. Vendors often produce graphics adapters specially designed for use with CAD software.\n\n• Audio/Video editing workstations. A workstation used to edit Audio/Video (A/V) files, create animations, or produce music will have high performance requirements. These computers must be able to support the demanding editing programs that audio/video technicians use in post-production editing functions. Most professional videos taken today include special effects and CGI (computer generated imagery) that is all applied after the digital video is taken.\n\nAgain, it is important not to overlook the disk subsystem, which can become a performance bottleneck as media files will often have to be streamed from the disk. Workstations will generally need 10 K or 15 K disks to perform well. Multimedia files are also extremely large, so the disk subsystem will have to be very high capacity. This means that the best performing Solid State Drive (SSD) storage may not be affordable at the capacities required.\n\nThese workstations require specialized adapters to capture audio and video from a variety of sources.\n\n• An input/output (I/O) card allows audio/video input to be sampled and saved as a digital file. As with a consumer-level video capture card, an I/O card can use an HDMI or Thunderbolt connection to a recording device, but Serial Data Interface (SDI) over 75 ohm coax cabling is a more likely option for broadcast-quality equipment.\n\n• For music recording and production, professional-level sound cards, referred to as audio interfaces, feature numerous inputs, including ¼" phone plugs to connect microphone and amplifier equipment, S/PDIF ports, and 5-pin DIN ports for MIDI equipment. Audio interfaces are usually provisioned as external units, connected to the PC over USB or Thunderbolt, to avoid the problem of electrical interference from PC components when making recordings.\n\nOTHER REQUIREMENTS\nYou will also find other equipment might be required, such as:\n• Dual monitors. With all types of workstation, screen "real estate" is often at a premium. This means that they are often provisioned with two or more monitors.\n• RAID. As they are used to process critical data, where losing even an hour's work might represent a huge loss to the business, most workstations will be configured with a RAID disk system, to provide insurance against disk failure.\ntag: C1 L4 TE

COMPUTERS FOR HOME USE\nWhen not used solely for school homework, web browsing, and email, home computers are often specified as media centers or gaming rigs. When used for media streaming or gaming, these systems often require fast video, storage, and network connections. A home network might also have network attached storage or servers from which files can be shared.\n\nMost media center or gaming computers deployed for home use will fit one of the following profiles.\n\nHome theater PCs, home server PCs, and NAS.\n\n• A home theater PC (HTPC) can be used in place of consumer appliances such as personal video recorders (PVR) to watch and record TV broadcasts and play movies and music, either from local files or from streaming Internet services. The PC will need to be equipped with an appropriate TV tuner card to process the incoming TV signal (broadcast, cable, or satellite) and usually comes with a remote control (and peripherals such as the mouse and keyboard would normally be wireless). The HTPC is usually equipped with specific entertainment software that can be used to manage the music and video files stored on the computer. The PCs are generally located near the TV and other home entertainment devices and have a HTPC form factor, which is aesthetically appealing and designed to look similar to other home entertainment devices. They are also designed to be less noisy than a traditional PC, with more compact quieter cooling methods and the addition of sound dampening foam or padding to limit excessive noise generated by the fan and hard drive.\n\n• A home server PC is either an HTPC with a slightly expanded role or a\nrepurposed desktop or low-end PC server used primarily for file storage, media\nstreaming, and printer sharing. Such PCs do not need to be particularly powerful\nin terms of CPU and memory, but they will need a good network link. Most\nwould also be configured with RAID storage to reduce the risk of losing valuable\nmovie and audio files, even though there should be a backup system in place to\nprotect against theft, fire, or accidental deletion.\n\n• There are also purpose-built devices to fill a home server role. A Network Attached Storage (NAS) appliance is a hard drive (or RAID array) with a cut-down server board, usually running some form of Linux, that provides network access, various file sharing protocols, and a web management interface. The appliance is accessed over the network, either using a wired Ethernet port or Wi-Fi. In a SOHO network you would plug the NAS device into an Ethernet port on the Internet router.\n\nNote: Most network adapters (or Network Interface Cards [NIC]) in machines from the last few years will be Gigabit Ethernet capable. It may be worth upgrading the adapter on an older machine but you need to bear in mind that many of the SOHO Internet router appliances come with Fast Ethernet switch ports (100 Mbps) rather than Gigabit ones. It will usually make more sense to install two adapters and bond them. The vast majority of homes will be using Wi-Fi streaming in any case and the most useful upgrade will be to 802.11n or 802.11ac.\n\nAs well as sharing the disk resource, a NAS box will usually be able to share a printer. It will also be able to make files available over the Internet, using HTTP or FTP. Care needs to be taken to secure the device and the router/firewall properly if this is the case.\n\nSome NAS devices and home server PCs can stream media files to wireless speakers or an IP-enabled TV (or various other types of media player). A streaming media server will have higher demand for CPU, memory, and bandwidth than an ordinary file server.\n\n(https://4sorcero.s3.amazonaws.com/byteback/core_1/fig_core_1_227.png)\nMost SOHO Internet router appliances can perform a basic file and printer sharing function, using USB-attached storage. (Screenshot courtesy of TP-Link.)\n\nGaming PCs.\n• A PC built for gaming is almost always based around the latest graphics adapter technology. Of course, the latest games tend to be able to make the latest graphics technology obsolete within a few months of release, so upgrade potential is a key characteristic of these systems. PC games feature lots of media assets that must be loaded from permanent storage so a fast drive technology such as a Solid State Drive (SSD) is preferable to slower hard disks (HDD).\n\nGaming PCs will share some of the traits of a home theater PC: surround sound audio and a high quality display. There are also gaming-oriented peripherals, such as keyboards and mice. Many games also benefit from headsets, so that players can bark instructions at one another as they eliminate enemies over the Internet. Low-latency, high bandwidth Internet access is almost as important to the average gamer as the frame rate the system's GPU can achieve.\n\nThe addictive nature of PC games means that the processors are very highly utilized, or thrashed for considerable periods of time. Some gamers are also fond of overclocking components to obtain better performance. All this means that a gaming PC will generate more heat than most other types of computer. It is not unusual for them to use more powerful fans (which must run silently of course) or liquid cooling.\n\nThere are many different peripherals used within the gaming world. The most common ones include the mouse and keyboard, but there are others that may be used depending on the type of game played. These might include: • Gaming mice that are either wired or wireless and include many buttons and different ergonomic form factors.\n• Customized keypads, with moveable keys.\n• Steering wheels used for auto racing games.\n• 3D glasses.\n• Specialized gaming mouse pads.\n• Specialized audio system.\n• PC video camera.\ntag: C1 L4 TE

GUIDELINES FOR SELECTING COMPONENTS FOR A CUSTOM PERSONAL COMPUTER\nHere are some guidelines to consider when selecting components for custom personal\n\nSELECT COMPONENTS FOR A CUSTOM COMPUTER\nFollow these guidelines when selecting components for a custom computer:\n• Verify that the computer meets or exceeds the operating system and application requirements. This should include the fastest and most reliable:\n• RAM\n• CPU\n• Storage subsystem\n• Video subsystem, including a fast refresh rate on the monitor\n• Verify you know what the main intention of the computer will be for. It might be for CAD/CAM, A/V editing, watching TV and movies, or gaming. While each of these types of custom computers require better performance than the average PC, each will likely have specific requirements that should be verified with the end user.\n• Consider installing additional cooling mechanisms to keep the system from overheating.\n• Verify that the network card, the router, and the network cabling or Wi-Fi signal are all capable of the highest possible speed.\n• Consider purchasing specialized devices for the work that will be performed on the custom computer. This might include specialized keyboards, mice, or other adapters to connect specific devices such as MIDI instruments, video cameras, or manufacturing machines, to name just a few.\n• Implement a RAID system to help ensure data is not lost. This should be in addition to performing regular backups that are securely stored off site.\ntag: C1 L4 TE

Activity 4-9\nDiscussing Custom PC Configuration\n\nSCENARIO\nAnswer the following questions to check your understanding of the topic.\n\nQuestion 1. Which component is likely to be a performance bottleneck on a workstation used to edit digital movies?\n\nAnswer 1. The disk subsystem is most likely to cause the performance bottleneck. The files will be too large to be stored completely in system memory and so must be streamed from the disk, which will need to be both large and fast.\n\nQuestion 2. For what type of workstation is a CPU with 4 or more cores particularly well suited?\n\nAnswer 2. Multiple cores benefit software that can take advantage of multi-threading. Examples include virtualization software and Rapid Application Development (RAD) tools.\n\nQuestion 3. You are specifying a PC to act as a home theater. What multimedia outputs should it support?\n\nAnswer 3. Surround sound audio outputs to the speaker system and HDMI to the TV screen.\n\nQuestion 4. Which factors are most likely to make a PC used for gaming require high-end cooling?\n\nAnswer 4. These PCs use at least two heavyweight processors: the CPU and GPU. Also, gamers are more likely than most other users to overclock components to improve performance. Overclocking requires very effective thermal management solutions.\n\nQuestion 5. On a thin client, which component is more important: NIC or HDD?\n\nAnswer 5. Thin clients do not need much permanent storage at all—some can make do without any mass storage. They do not generate that much network traffic either but that said, the NIC is the more important component here.\n\nQuestion 6. Why might high-spec components (CPU, memory, RAID) not be a good idea in a home theater PC?\n\nAnswer 6. These devices need to operate as quietly as possible and using high-spec components means heat, heat requires cooling, cooling usually means fans, and fans mean noise.\ntag: C1 L4 TE A4-9

Activity 4-10\nSelecting Components for Custom Workstations\n\nSCENARIO\nYou have been asked by your manager to evaluate the hardware and software needs for all the clients within the Human Resources (HR) department of your organization. There was a recent reorganization of the department, and some of the job roles and functions have changed. Based on the recent changes, you need to review the job functions and identify what type of client workstation will meet those needs.\n\nQuestion 1. A user needs to be able to access the central employee data repository to run reports, but does not need access to any local applications used to create, edit, and manage the employee data. The employee data is managed on a server that can be accessed with a log in. What type of client is best in this case?\n\nAnswer 1. Thin client\n\nQuestion 2. June has recently been put in charge of making updates to the Human Resource employee benefits website. She will be publishing a monthly newsletter and posting company-wide announcements, among other small updates and changes, on a regular basis. All changes to the website must be tested on a number of platforms and web browsers to verify that the changes are correct regardless of the operating system and browser. What type of client setup would you suggest for her?\n\nAnswer 2. Answers will vary, but will most likely include a virtualization workstation so that she can switch from different operating systems and test any website changes quickly.\n\nQuestion 3. In order to properly support the HR employee benefits website, a new server running client VMs has been installed so that the environment that the application requires can be strictly administered by IT staff. Current PCs will be used to access the Client VM environment that is configured on the VM Server. What needs to be present at all PCs that will be accessing this new server and application?\n\nAnswer 3. Appropriately configured VM Client. Fast network connection to server hosting the VM environment. Upgrade to video cards.\n\nQuestion 4. True or False? The HR manager's client computer must meet the recommended requirements to run Windows 10 so that she can access and use all of the HR-related applications used by the organization. In this case, the best client option is a thick client.\n\nAnswer 4. True\ntag: C1 L4 TE A4-10

Activity 4-11\nSelecting Components for Custom\nPersonal Computers\n\nSCENARIO\n \nYou are a support technician for a local business that specializes in consulting,  purchasing, and installing home computing solutions for consumers. You are responsible for fulfilling all the orders that have come in overnight through the business' website.\n\nQuestion 1. Customer 1 is using a desktop PC to play home movies and to set up slide shows to show his family their vacation photos and is having difficulty with the computer freezing during the movies. He is looking for a solution that will allow him to store and play his movies seamlessly through a computer. He also wants his wife to be able to access the pictures and movies from her laptop within the house. What type of computer setup would you suggest for this customer? What specific questions might you ask this customer about additional component needs?\n\nAnswer 1. Answers may vary, but will most likely include setting up a home server PC for easy file sharing among the household computing devices and to provide more speed to play movies from the PC. You may ask if they are in need of additional storage space and if they are looking for redundancy through a RAID array in the PC.\n\nQuestion 2. Customer 2 is from a small real estate office who has recently hired a graphic designer to produce informational pamphlets and other marketing materials for the agency, such as property drop sheets and circular layout designs. The office manager has asked your company to determine the hardware and software needs for the designer's workstation so that it can be ordered and set up before their scheduled start date in two weeks. What hardware and software requirements would you suggest for the graphic designer's workstation?\n\nAnswer 2. Answers may vary, but will most likely include a PC with a high-end, multicore processor, a high end video card, and the maximum RAM that the motherboard can handle. In addition, the motherboard should contain multiple high-speed ports for peripherals such as external hard drives or additional video cards. The applications will most likely include Adobe's Creative Cloud or similar graphic-design software.\n\nQuestion 3. Customer 3 is looking to make the switch from a traditional TV cable box and DVD player to a home theater PC, so that she can stream Netflix and record shows and movies from her TV. She already purchased a computer from a local home entertainment store but cannot figure out why she cannot connect the cable TV wire into the computer. What would you check for first?\n\nAnswer 3. She needs to have a TV tuner card installed in the computer. The tuner card provides the port to connect the cable from the provider to the computer. You would also want to verify that the tuner card is correctly configured, and that all device drivers are installed and up-to-date.\ntag: C1 L4 TE A4-11
