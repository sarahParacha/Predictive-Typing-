PRINTER TYPES\n\nA printer is a device that produces text and images from electronic data onto physical media such as paper, photo paper, and labels. A printer output of electronic documents is often referred to as hard copy. Printers employ a range of technologies; the quality of the print output varies with the printer type and generally in proportion to the printer cost.\n\nA printer or type printer technology is the mechanism used to make images on the paper. The most common types for general home and office use are inkjet (or ink dispersion) and laser, though others are used for more specialist applications. Some of the major print device vendors include HP, Epson, Canon, Xerox, Brother, OKI, Konica/Minolta, Lexmark, Ricoh, and Samsung.\n\nThere are many types of printers. Each type of printer, and each printer from different manufacturers, implements the printing process slightly differently. All of the printers will have the following common components:\n• A connection to computing devices.\n• A mechanism for creating text and images.\n• A paper feed mechanism.\n• Paper input and output options.\n\nEach of these will be discussed in detail throughout this lesson.\n\nPRINTER FEATURES\nThe following criteria are used to select the best type and model of printer.\n\nSPEED\nThe basic speed of a printer is measured in Pages Per Minute (ppm). You will see different speeds quoted for different types of output (for example, pages of monochrome text will print more quickly than color photos).\n\nINTERFACES\nAlmost all printers support USB, but printer models designed for workgroups also support network connections, usually at a higher cost than standard models. Wireless connections may also carry a price premium.\n\nIMAGE QUALITY\nThe basic measure of image quality is the maximum supported resolution, measured in dots per inch (dpi). Printer dots and screen image pixels are not equivalent. It requires multiple dots to reproduce one pixel at acceptable quality. Pixel dimensions are typically quoted in pixels per inch (ppi) to avoid confusion. Vertical and horizontal resolution are often different, so you may see figures such as 2400x600 quoted. The horizontal resolution is determined by the print engine (that is, either the laser scanning unit or inkjet print head); vertical resolution is determined by the paper handling mechanism.\n\nThe minimum resolution for a monochrome printer should be 600 dpi. Photo-quality printers start at 1200 dpi.\n\nResolution is not the only factor in determining overall print quality, however (especially with color output). When evaluating a printer, obtain samples to judge text and color performance.\n\nNote: Image quality needs to be matched to use. The best quality will be correspondingly expensive. Always request sample sheets when evaluating a printer.\n\nPAPER HANDLING\nPaper handling means the type of paper or media that can be loaded. It may be important that the printer can handle labels, envelopes, card stock, acetate, and so on. The amount of paper that can be loaded and output is also important in high volume environments. Overloaded output trays will cause paper jams. If the output tray is low capacity, this could happen quite quickly in a busy office.\n\nTOTAL COST OF OWNERSHIP (TCO)\nTCO is the cost of the printer over its lifetime, including the cost of replacement components and consumables. It is important to know how a printer will be used to work out TCO.\n\nOPTIONS\nOptions might include additional memory, duplex (double-sided) printing, large format (A3 and greater), binding, and so on. These may be fitted by default or available for additional purchase as optional extras.\n\nMULTI-FUNCTION DEVICE (MFD)\nAn MFD is a piece of office equipment that performs the functions of a number of other specialized devices. MFDs typically include the functions of a printer, scanner, fax machine, and copier. However, there are MFDs that do not include fax functions. Although the multifunction device might not equal the performance or feature sets of the dedicated devices it replaces, multi-function devices are very powerful and can perform most tasks adequately and are an economical and popular choice for most home or small-office needs.\nTag: C1 L10 TA

LASER PRINTERS\n\nA laser printer is a printer that uses a laser beam to project (or "draw") a latent image onto an electrically charged drum; toner adheres to the drum and is transferred onto the paper as the paper moves through the mechanism at the same speed the drum rotates. The toner is fixed using high heat and pressure, creating a durable printout that does not smear or fade.\n\nLaser printers are one of the most popular printer technologies for office applications because they are cheap (both to buy and to run), quiet, and fast, and they produce high quality output. There are both grayscale and color models.\nTag: C1 L10 TA

LASER PRINTER IMAGING PROCESS\n\nIn the laser printing process, laser printers print a page at a time using a combination of electrostatic charges, toner, and laser light. The laser print process follows the steps detailed in the following sections.\n\n(https://4sorcero.s3.amazonaws.com/byteback/core_1/fig_core_1_498.png)\nThe laser print process.\n\nPROCESSING\nLike most printers, laser printers produce their printed output in a series of dots. The computer encodes the page in a printer language and sends it to the printer. The printer's formatter board processes the data to create a bitmap (or raster) of the page and stores it in the printer's RAM.\n\nThe entire laser printer cycle takes place in one smooth sequence but, since the circumference of the drum that processes the image is smaller than a sheet of paper, the process must be repeated 2-4 times (according to size) to process a single page.\n\nCHARGING (CONDITIONING)\nThe electrostatic photographic (EP) drum, or imaging drum is conditioned by a corona wire powered by a high voltage power supply assembly. The corona wire applies a uniform -600 V electrical charge across the drum's surface. A laser printer has a power supply capable of generating very high voltages. It converts the supplied current to optimal AC and DC voltages for specific components, such as the corona wire.\n\nNote: The charging corona is also referred to as the primary corona. On most modern printers, the function of the charging corona wire is actually performed by a metal roller with a rubber coating—the Primary Charge Roller (PCR).\n\nEXPOSING (WRITING)\nThe surface coating of the photosensitive drum loses its charge when exposed to light. A laser neutralizes the charge that was applied by the corona wire selectively, dot-by-dot and line-by-line, as the drum rotates. The laser-scanning assembly houses a small, low-power laser, similar to that used in an optical drive. As the laser receives the image information, it fires a short pulse of light for each dot in the raster. The pulsing light beam is reflected by a rotating polygonal mirror through a system of lenses onto the photosensitive drum. The drum ends up with a whole series of raster lines with charge/no-charge areas that represent an electrostatic latent image of the image to be printed.\n\nDEVELOPING\nLaser (and photocopier) toner is composed of a fine compound of dyestuff and either wax or plastic particles. The toner is fed evenly onto a magnetized roller (the developer roller) from a hopper.\n\nThe developer roller is located very close to the photosensitive drum. The toner carries the same negative charge polarity as the drum, which means that, under normal circumstances, there would be no interaction between the two parts. However, once areas of charge have been selectively removed from the photosensitive drum by the laser, the toner is attracted to them and sticks to those parts of its surface. The drum, now coated with toner in the image of the document, rotates until it reaches the paper.\n\nTRANSFERRING\nThe paper transport mechanism includes components such as gears, pads, and rollers that move the paper through the printer. Paper loaded into a tray should be held by media guides. The printer uses sensors from the guides to detect the paper type. Different trays may support different types, sizes, and thicknesses of media. Pickup components lift a single sheet of paper from the selected input tray and feed it into the printer. To do this, a pickup roller turns once against the paper stack, pushing the paper into a feed and separation roller assembly (the manual feed tray uses a separation pad rather than rollers). This assembly is designed to allow only one sheet to pass through.\n\n(https://4sorcero.s3.amazonaws.com/byteback/core_1/fig_core_1_499.png)\nPickup, feed, and separation rollers on an HP 5Si laser printer.\n\nWhen the paper reaches the registration roller, a signal tells the printer to start the image development process. When the drum is ready, the paper is fed between the photosensitive drum and the high voltage transfer roller (or secondary corona). The transfer roller applies a positive charge to the underside of the paper. This causes the toner on the drum to be attracted to the paper. As the paper leaves the transfer assembly, a static eliminator strip (or detac corona) removes any remaining charge from the paper, which might otherwise cause it to stick to the drum or curl as it enters the fuser unit.\n\nFUSING\nFrom the drum and transfer assembly, the paper passes into the fuser assembly. The fuser unit squeezes the paper between a hot roller and a pressure roller so that the toner is fused, or melted, onto the surface of the paper. The hot roller is a metal tube containing a heat lamp; the pressure roller is typically silicon rubber. The heat roller has a Teflon coating to prevent toner from sticking to it.\n\nCLEANING\nTo complete the printing cycle, the photosensitive drum is cleaned to remove any remaining toner particles using a cleaning blade, roller, or brush resting on the surface of the drum. Any residual electrical charge is removed using either a discharge (or erase lamp) or the primary charge roller.\n\nDUPLEX PRINTING AND PAPER OUTPUT PATH\nWhen the paper has passed through the fuser, if a duplexing assembly unit is installed, it is turned over and returned to the developer unit to print the second side. Otherwise, the paper is directed to the selected output bin using the exit rollers.\n\nIf there is no auto duplex unit, the user can manually flip the paper stack. When duplex mode is selected for the print job, the printer pauses after printing the first side of each sheet. The user must then take the printed pages and return them (without changing the orientation) to the same input paper tray. Once this is done, the user resumes the print job.\n\nCOLOR LASER PRINTERS\nColor laser printers, once very highly priced and positioned at the top end of the market, are becoming more affordable, with medium quality, entry-level models priced competitively against inkjet equivalents. Color lasers use separate color toner cartridges (Cyan, Magenta, Yellow, and Black) but employ different processes to create the image. Some may use four passes to put down each color; others combine the colors on a transfer belt and print in one pass.\n\nLED PRINTERS\nA traditional laser printer uses a laser with a rotating mirror and prisms to scan across each raster line. An LED printer uses a fixed array of tiny Light Emitting Diodes (LED) to create the light pulses for each dot in each scan line. Vendors claim that with fewer moving parts, LED printers can be more reliable than lasers, but damage to the LED array is expensive to repair. LED printers are usually much lighter than laser printers, however, and print speeds can be a bit faster.\nTag: C1 L10 TA

LASER PRINTER MAINTENANCE TASKS\n\nAs devices with moving parts and consumable items that deplete quickly, printers need more maintenance than most other computer devices. Printers generate a lot of dirt— principally paper dust and ink/toner spills—and consequently require regular cleaning. Consumable items also require replacing frequently under heavy use. To keep them working in good condition requires a regular maintenance schedule and user training.\n\nOne of the first steps in maximizing the lifetime of a printer is to train users to treat it with sufficient care and attention. Depending on the environment, users might be expected to perform basic maintenance tasks—such as reloading paper and changing cartridges. Typical problems include:\n• Overloading input trays or output trays (not collecting completed jobs promptly).\n• Using unsuitable media—for example, card stock or labels in an auto-feed tray.\n• Using creased, folded, or dirty paper.\n• Breaking trays or covers.\n• Inserting ink or toner cartridges incorrectly.\n\nIt is also easy for users to be confused by settings such as default paper size, form-to-tray assignment, duplex printing, printing to labels or envelopes, collating multiple copies, and dealing with paper jams.\n\nNote: For best results and to stay within warranty, use branded supplies designed for the specific model of printer.\n\nMost laser printers benefit from regular, routine maintenance to ensure optimum print quality.\n\nLOADING PAPER\nThe printer will report when a tray runs out of paper. When loading new paper, remember the following guidelines:\n• Use good quality paper designed for use with the model of printer that you have and the printing function.\n• Do not overload a paper tray.\n• Do not use creased, dirty, or damp paper.\n• Refer to the instruction manual when loading non-standard print media, such as transparencies or envelopes. Make sure this type of material is oriented correctly to avoid wasting stocks.\n\nYou will also need to deal with paper jams. The printer's status panel will indicate what area of the printer is jammed. Check the instruction manual to find out how to remove any components that might prevent you from removing the paper.\n\nNote: Do not allow a jammed page to rip! If a page is stuck in the fuser or developer unit, look for a release mechanism or lever.\n\nREPLACING THE TONER CARTRIDGE\nLaser printer toner is a fine powder made of particles of iron, carbon, and resin. Laser printers require a toner cartridge, which is a single, replaceable unit that contains toner as well as additional components used in image production. You will need to maintain a supply of the proper toner cartridges for your printer model. Refill or recycle empty toner cartridges; do not dispose of them in regular trash.\n\nUsers can change toner cartridges, but everyone should follow proper handling procedures, which are usually printed right on the cartridge. When toner is low, the printer will display a status message advising you of the fact. Frugal departments may continue printing until the actual output starts to dip in quality. Removing the cartridge and rocking gently from front-to-back can help to get the most out of it.\n\nTo replace the toner cartridge, remove the old cartridge by opening the relevant service panel and pulling it out. Place the cartridge in a bag to avoid shedding toner everywhere. Color lasers will usually have four cartridges for the different colors, which can be replaced separately.\n\n(https://4sorcero.s3.amazonaws.com/byteback/core_1/fig_core_1_502.png)\nAccessing the toner cartridge on a printer. (Image by Andriy Popov © 123RF.com.)\n\nTake the new cartridge and remove the packing strips as indicated by the instructions. Rock the cartridge gently from front-to-back to distribute the toner evenly. Insert the cartridge, close the service panel, turn on, and print a test page. If possible, dispose of old cartridges by recycling them.\n\nNote: The replacement cartridge often incorporates both toner and the photosensitive drum. An integrated toner cartridge/drum unit is light-sensitive. If you remove it, place it in its storage bag or in a dark area. Remove the cartridge for as short a time as possible.\n\nCLEANING A PRINTER\nThe manufacturer's recommendations for cleaning and maintenance must always be followed, but the following guidelines generally apply:\n• Unplug the printer before cleaning or performing routine maintenance.\n• Use a damp cloth to clean exterior surfaces.\n• Do not use volatile liquids such as thinners or benzene to clean the interior or exterior of the printer. Use only approved cleaning solutions or solvents specifically designed for the job.\n• The inside of the printer may be hot—take care.\n• Wipe dust and toner away with a soft cloth. DO NOT use an ordinary domestic vacuum cleaner. Toner is conductive and can damage the motor. Toner is also so fine that it will pass straight through the dust collection bag and back into the room.\nUse an approved toner safe vacuum if necessary.\n\nNote: Do not use compressed air or an air blaster to clean a laser printer! You risk blowing toner dust into the room, creating a health hazard. Compressed air should only be used in a controlled environment with appropriate safety masks and goggles.\n\n• If toner is spilt on skin or clothes, wash it off with COLD water. Hot water will open the skin's pores and push the toner into the skin.\n• Use IPA (99% Isopropyl Alcohol solution) and non-scratch, lint-free swabs to clean rollers. Take care not to scratch a roller.\n• Check the manufacturer's recommendations for replacing the printer's dust/ozone filters (if fitted).\n\nCALIBRATING A PRINTER\nCalibration is the process by which the printer determines the appropriate print density or color balance (basically, how much toner to use). Most printers calibrate themselves automatically. If print output is not as expected, you can often invoke the calibration routine from the printer's control panel or its software driver.\n\nREPLACING THE MAINTENANCE KIT\nA maintenance kit is a set of replacement feed rollers, new transfer roller, and a new fuser unit. The feed rollers guide paper through the printer assembly. When they begin to wear out, paper jams become more frequent. Wear on the fuser or rollers is also evidenced by consistent marks on print output or excess toner "blobs" appearing on sheets.\n\nReplacement of the maintenance kit is guided by the printer's internal record of the number of pages that it has printed (copy count). The printer's status indicator will display the message "Maintenance Kit Replace" at this point.\n\nBefore replacing the kit, turn off the printer, disconnect from the power, open the service panels, and allow it to cool (the fuser unit becomes extremely hot and may cause burns). Remove the old fuser and rollers and clean the printer. Install the fuser and new rollers (don't forget to remove the packing strips), following the instructions carefully.\n\n(https://4sorcero.s3.amazonaws.com/byteback/core_1/fig_core_1_503.png)\nAn example of a maintenance kit with feed rollers, new transfer rollers and a new fuser unit. (Image by Inga Tihonova © 123RF.com.)\n\nOnce you have replaced the maintenance kit, start the printer up and print a test page to check functionality. Use the property sheet or the printer's control panel menu (for example, the Configuration menu on an HP printer) to reset the page count to zero.\n\nAs with toner cartridges, try to use a recycling program to dispose of the fuser unit in an environmentally responsible manner.\nTag: C1 L10 TA

Activity 10-1\nDiscussing Laser Printer Maintenance\n\nSCENARIO\nAnswer the following questions to check your understanding of the topic.\n\nQuestion 1. Why is a laser printer better suited to most office printing tasks than an inkjet?\n\nAnswer 1. Laser printers are much faster, quieter, and better quality (the pages do not smear) than inkjets at this type of output. They also have lower running costs.\n\nQuestion 2. What makes the power supply in a printer different to that used in a PC?\n\nAnswer 2. A PC's Power Supply Unit (PSU) only needs to generate voltages up to 12 V DC. The charging and transfer corona wires/rollers in a laser printer require much higher voltages. To apply a 600 V charge to the drum, for instance, the corona wire must be charged to 1000 V.\n\nQuestion 3. How is the imaging drum in a laser printer charged?\n\nAnswer 3. Applying a uniform high charge to the photosensitive drum using the primary corona wire or roller.\n\nQuestion 4. What is the removal of the charge from the photosensitive drum by a laser called?\n\nAnswer 4. Laser imaging or writing.\n\nQuestion 5. What is the process of image transfer?\n\nAnswer 5. Passing paper between the photosensitive drum and the secondary or transfer corona wire or roller. This attracts the toner from the drum to the paper.\n\nQuestion 6. What must you do before installing a new toner cartridge into a printer?\n\nAnswer 6. Remove the packing strips. The printer should also be turned off, and the old cartridge should be removed and placed into a sealed bag for recycling.\n\nQuestion 7. Which components are provided as part of a laser printer maintenance kit?\n\nAnswer 7. The main component is a new fuser assembly. The kit will also usually contain a transfer/secondary charge roller plus paper transport rollers for each tray (pickup rollers and a new separation pad).\nTag: C1 L10 TA A10-1

Topic B\nMaintain Inkjet Printers\n\nEXAM OBJECTIVES COVERED\n1001-3.11 Given a scenario, install and maintain various print technologies.\n\nInkjets are often used for good-quality color output and domestic use. Inkjets are typically cheap to buy but expensive to run, with high cost consumables such as ink cartridges and high-grade paper. Compared to laser printers, they are slower and often noisier, making them less popular in office environments, except as a cheap option for low volume, good quality color printing.\nTag: C1 L10 TB

INKJET PRINTERS\n\nAn inkjet—or more generally ink dispersion—printer forms images by firing microscopic droplets of liquid ink out of nozzles mounted together on a carriage assembly that moves back and forth across the paper. The printer can use heat or vibrations to release the ink.\n\nColor images are created by combining four inks, referred to as  CMYK (Cyan, Magenta, Yellow, and Black [K]). The inks are stored in separate reservoirs, which may be supplied in single or multiple cartridges.\n\nNote: The "K" in CMYK is usually explained as standing for "key," as in a key plate used to align the other plates in the sort of offset print press used for professional color printing in high volumes. It might be more helpful to think of it as "blacK," though.\n\nThere are many types of inkjet printers, ranging from cheaper desktop models, through "prosumer" high quality photo printers, to large format, commercial print solutions. Higher quality printers feature additional ink colors (light magenta and light cyan). These help to produce a wider range of colors (gamut).\nTag: C1 L10 TB

INKJET PRINTER IMAGING PROCESS\n\nInkjets work by firing microscopic droplets of ink (about 50 microns in size) at the paper. The process creates high quality images, especially when specially treated paper is used, but they can be prone to smearing and fading over time.\n\nAn inkjet print head is composed of a series of very small holes or nozzles, behind which can be found a reservoir of ink. Under normal conditions, the ink cannot flow though the nozzles because the gap is very small, and the ink reservoir is kept at a pressure slightly below that of the ambient pressure. Characters are formed when a small controlled amount of ink is forced through voltage-charged deflection plates and onto the paper. By synchronizing this action with the movement of the print head across the paper, text and images can be built up in a series of differently shaded or colored dots.\n\nInkjet printers are line printers—where laser printers are page printers—because they build up the image line-by-line (or at least, row-by-row). A stepper motor moves the print head across the page, advancing a tiny amount each time. On some types of printer, ink is applied when the print head moves in one direction only (unidirectional); on others, ink is applied on both the "outward" and "return" passes over the page (bidirectional). When a line or row has been completed, another stepper motor advances the page a little bit and the next line or row is printed.\n\nIf the printer has been idle for some time (or when it is first started up), it applies a cleaning cycle to the print head to remove any dried or clogged ink. This means pushing ink through all the print heads at once then wiping it away into a waste ink collector. The cleaning cycle can also be invoked manually through the printer control panel or driver.\n\n(https://4sorcero.s3.amazonaws.com/byteback/core_1/fig_core_1_507.png)\nThe inkjet printing process.\nTag: C1 L10 TB

COMPONENTS OF INKJET PRINTERS\n\nThere are two main Ink Delivery Systems (IDS). The charge (or piezoelectric) method is used by Epson. The thermal method is used by HP, Canon (who refer to it as Bubblejet), and Lexmark. Each of these four vendors has licensed their inkjet technology to several other vendors or produce re-branded versions of their printers.\n\nTHERMAL PRINT HEADS\nWith the thermal method, the ink at the nozzle is heated, creating a bubble. When the bubble bursts, it sprays ink through the nozzle and draws more ink from the reservoir. In general, thermal inkjet print heads are cheaper and simpler to produce, but the heating elements have a relatively short life. Most thermal printers use a combined print head and ink reservoir. When the ink runs out, the print head is also replaced.\n\nPIEZOELECTRIC PRINT HEADS\nIn the Epson design, the nozzle contains a piezoelectric element, which changes shape when a voltage is applied. This acts like a small pump, pushing ink through the nozzle and drawing ink from the reservoir.\n\nINK CARTRIDGES\nInkjet print heads are often considered consumable items. Often this is unavoidable because the print head is built into the ink cartridge, as is the case with most (but not all) thermal print heads. Epson piezoelectric print heads are non-removable and designed to last as long as the rest of the printer components.\n\nAs well as containing ink, the ink reservoir has sensors to detect the level of ink remaining. A color printer has at least four ink reservoirs (Black, Cyan, Magenta, and Yellow). The four ink reservoirs may come in a single cartridge or there may be separate cartridges for black and colored ink or each ink may come in its own cartridge.\n\n(https://4sorcero.s3.amazonaws.com/byteback/core_1/fig_core_1_508a.png)\nInk cartridges. (Image by © 123RF.com.)\n\nCARRIAGE SYSTEM\nThe print head is moved back and forth over the paper by a carriage system. This comprises a stepper motor (to drive the system), a pulley and belt (to move the print head), a guide shaft (to keep the print head stable), and sensors (to detect the position of the print head). A flat ribbon data cable connects the print head to the printer's circuit board.\n\nThere may also be a lever used to set the platen gap or the printer may adjust this automatically depending on driver settings. The platen gap is the distance between the print head and the paper. Having an adjustable platen gap allows the printer to use thicker media.\n\n(https://4sorcero.s3.amazonaws.com/byteback/core_1/fig_core_1_508b.png)\nThe carriage mechanism in an inkjet printer. (Image by Erik Bobeldijk © 123RF.com.)\n\nPAPER HANDLING AND DUPLEXING ASSEMBLY\nMost inkjets only support one paper path, with single input and output trays, though some have automatic duplexers, and some may have accessory trays. Printers are generally split between models that load from the top and output at the bottom and those that have both input and output bins at the bottom and turn the paper (an "up-and-over" path).\n\nThe paper pickup mechanism is quite similar to that of a laser printer. Paper is fed into the printer by an AutoSheet Feeder (ASF) mechanism. A load roller turns against the paper stack to move the top sheet while a separation roller prevents more than one sheet entering.\n\nWhen the paper is sufficiently advanced, it is detected by a sensor. Feed rollers and sensors then ensure the paper is positioned correctly for printing to begin. The stepper motor controlling the paper feed mechanism advances the paper as the print head completes each pass until the print is complete.\n\nThe eject rollers then deliver the paper to the duplexing assembly (if installed and duplex printing has been selected) or the output bin. Some inkjets with a curved paper path may have a "straight-through" rear panel for bulkier media.\nTag: C1 L10 TB

INKJET PRINTER MAINTENANCE TASKS\n\nInkjets do not usually handle such high print volumes as laser printers, so maintenance focuses on paper stocking and replacing or refilling ink cartridges, which always seem to run down very quickly. Manufacturers recommend not trying to clean inside the case as you are likely to do harm for no real benefit. The outside of the printer can be cleaned using a soft damp cloth.\n\nLOADING PAPER\nInkjets tend to have smaller paper trays than laser printers and so can need restocking with paper more often. Most inkjets can use "regular" copier/laser printer paper but better results can be obtained by using less absorbent premium grades of paper stock, specifically designed for inkjet use. Often this type of paper is designed to be printed on one side only—make sure the paper is correctly oriented when loading the printer.\n\nAs with laser printers, you will also need to clear paper jams. With an inkjet, it is usually easy to see exactly where the paper has jammed. If the sheet will not come out easily, do not just try to pull it harder—check the instruction manual to find out how to release any components that might prevent you from removing the paper.\n\nREPLACE INKJET CARTRIDGES\nWhen the inkjet's driver software determines that a cartridge is empty, it will prompt you to replace it. Check the printer's instruction manual for the correct procedure.\n\nOTHER INKJET MAINTENANCE OPERATIONS\nTwo other operations may be required periodically.\n• Print head alignment—if output is not aligned correctly, use the print head alignment function from the printer's property sheet to calibrate the printer. This is typically done automatically when you replace the ink cartridges.\n• Print head cleaning—a blocked or dirty nozzle will show up on output as a missing line. Use the printer's cleaning cycle (accessed via the property sheet or control panel) to try to fix the problem.

Activity 10-2\nDiscussing Inkjet Printer Maintenance\n\nSCENARIO\nAnswer the following questions to check your understanding of the topic.\n\nQuestion 1. Which inks are typically used in the color printing process?\n\nAnswer 1. Cyan, Magenta, Yellow, and Black (CMYK). Do be aware that some printers can use more inks. For example, a 6-color printer might add Light Cyan and Light Magenta inks, or Orange and Green inks (hexachrome).\n\nQuestion 2. What two types of print heads are used by inkjet printers?\n\nAnswer 2. Thermal and piezoelectric. The thermal type is also known by Canon's Bubble Jet trademark because of the way the print head creates an ink bubble by heating. Most other printer vendors use thermal technology but Epson printers use their piezoelectric pump-like process.\n\nQuestion 3. You have been asked to perform basic maintenance on an inkjet printer. One of the users noticed that the colors are not printing correctly and that the bottom of some letters are not printing. What would you do?\n\nAnswer 3. Try using the printer's built-in cleaning cycle, and then replacing the ink cartridge. If these do not work, try using an after market cleaning product. Try using the printer properties sheet to check for print head alignment, color settings, and other settings.\n\nQuestion 4. Can inkjet printers use plain copy paper?\n\nAnswer 4. Yes, but this type of paper will not produce the best results. It is better to use paper designed for inkjets. There are different grades of inkjet paper. Higher-grade paper allows for glossy photo printing.\n\nQuestion 5. What is an ASF?\n\nAnswer 5. An AutoSheet Feeder (ASF) allows the printer to load a sheet of paper from a tray, using pickup rollers to move the sheet and a separation pad to make sure only a single sheet is fed at one time.\nTag: C1 L10 TB A10-2

Topic C\nMaintain Impact, Thermal, and 3D Printers\n\nEXAM OBJECTIVES COVERED\n1001-3.11 Given a scenario, install and maintain various print technologies.\n\nLaser and inkjet printers are widely deployed but there are a number of other printer types that are better optimized for certain tasks. In this topic, you will learn about Learners are less likely thermal, impact, and 3D printer types.\nTag: C1 L10 TC

IMPACT PRINTERS\n\nAn impact printer strikes an inked ribbon against paper to leave marks. One common type is the dot matrix printer, which uses a column of pins (also called print wires) to strike the ribbon.\n\nDesktop dot matrix printers are no longer very widely deployed, but they are still used for specialist functions such as printing invoices or pay slips, on continuous, tractor-fed paper. Portable models are still widely used for printing receipts.\n\n(https://4sorcero.s3.amazonaws.com/byteback/core_1/fig_core_1_512.png)\nExample of a dot matrix printer. (Image © 123RF.com.)\n\nCOMPONENTS OF IMPACT PRINTERS\nImpact printers are composed of a ribbon cartridge, rollers, and pins for moving paper through the printer, a printhead composed of a number of electromagnetic pins, and some optional components, which might include a paper tray, an output tray, and a support for sheet-fed paper.\n\nIMPACT PRINTER CONSUMABLES\nImpact printers can be used with either plain, carbon, or tractor-fed paper:\n• Plain paper is held firmly against the moving roller (the platen) and pulled through the mechanism by friction as the platen rotates. A cut sheet feeder may be added to some printers to automate the process of providing the next page.\n• Carbon paper (or impact paper) is used to make multiple copies of a document in the same pass (hence carbon copy, or "cc"). A sheet of carbon paper is inserted between each sheet of plain paper and when the print head strikes, the same mark is made on each sheet.\n• Tractor-fed paper is fitted with removable, perforated side strips. The holes in these strips are secured over studded rollers at each end of the platen. This type of paper is more suitable for multi-part stationery as there is less chance of skewing or slippage since the end rollers fix the movement of the paper.\n\nPAPER FEED MECHANISMS\nImpact printers can use either tractor feed when printing on continuous-roll impact paper, or friction feed when printing on individually cut sheets of paper. Tractor feed uses pairs of wheels with pins evenly spaced around the circumference at a set spacing. Continuous-roll paper with matching holes in the edges fits over the pins. The wheels turn and pull the paper through the printer. There are usually just two wheels, but there might be additional wheels or pin guides that the paper is latched to. There is usually a lever or other setting on the printer that needs to be engaged in order to use the tractor feed.\n\nFriction feed uses two rollers placed one on top of the other. The rollers turn to force individual cut sheets of paper or envelopes through the paper path. This is used to print on individual sheets of paper (cut-sheet paper) and envelopes. Be sure to set the printer lever or other setting to the cut-sheet mode when printing using friction feed.\nTag: C1 L10 TC

IMPACT PRINTER RIBBONS\n\nAn impact printer will also have some form of replaceable ribbon. Older-style printers used to have a two-spool ribbon. However, most units now have a cartridge device that slots over or around the carriage of the print head. These integrated ribbons simplify the design of the printer because they can be made as a complete loop moving in one direction only. The two-spool design requires a sensor and reversing mechanism to change the direction of the ribbon when it reaches the end.\n\nWhen the ribbon on an impact printer fails to produce sufficiently good print quality, the ribbon-holder and contents are normally replaced as a whole. Some printers can use a re-usable cartridge.\n\nIMPACT PRINTER IMAGING PROCESS\nIn a dot matrix printer, the pins are contained in the print head, which is secured to a moving carriage that sweeps across the paper. The pins are fired by coils of wire called solenoids. When a coil is energized, it forms a strong electromagnet that causes the metal firing pin to move sharply forwards, striking the ink-bearing ribbon against the paper. A strong permanent magnet moves the pins back into their resting position immediately after firing.\n\nNote: Do not touch the print head after using the printer. The print head can become very hot, even after short periods of use.\n\nThe output quality of a dot-matrix printer is largely governed by the number of pins in the print head. Most modern printers use 9-pin or 24-pin print heads. The latter offer a much-improved print quality. More sophisticated printers may use 48-pin print heads, although if you require this level of quality, an inkjet or laser printer may be a better option.\n\nA platen gap lever is often fitted to printers capable of printing on multi-part stationery. This lever adjusts the gap between the print head and the platen to accommodate different thickness of paper. Incorrect adjustment of the platen gap can cause faint printing (gap too wide) or smudging (too narrow). On more sophisticated printers, the platen gap is adjusted automatically.\nTag: C1 L10 TC

IMPACT PRINTER MAINTENANCE TIPS\n\nWhen you are loading a tractor-fed impact printer with paper, ensure that the holes in the paper are engaged in the sprockets and that the paper can enter the printer cleanly. Ensure that the lever is in the correct position for friction feed or tractor feed as appropriate for the media being used. Follow the manufacturer's instructions to replace the print head or ribbon cartridge. Take care, as the print head may become very hot during use.\nTag: C1 L10 TC

THERMAL PRINTERS\n\nA thermal printer is a general term for any printer that uses a heating element to create the image on the paper with dye, ink from ribbons, or directly with pins while the feed assembly moves the media through the printer. There are several types of thermal printers that use significantly different technologies and are intended for different uses. The dye sublimation print process can be used for photo quality output and thermal wax transfer  printers can be used as an alternative to color laser printing, but the most common type of thermal printer you are likely to have to support is the direct thermal printer.\n\n(https://4sorcero.s3.amazonaws.com/byteback/core_1/fig_core_1_512.png)\nA direct thermal receipt printer. (Image © 123RF.com.)\n\nPortable or small form factor direct thermal transfer printers are used for high volume barcode and label printing and also to print receipts. Such devices typically support 200-300 dpi, with some models able to print one or two colors. Print speeds are measured in inches per second.\nTag: C1 L10 TC

COMPONENTS OF THERMAL PRINTERS\n\nMost direct thermal print devices require special thermal paper that contains chemicals designed to react and change color as it is heated by the Components of within the printer to create images.\n\nIn the feed assembly on a direct thermal printer, paper is friction-fed through the print mechanism by a stepper motor turning a rubber-coated roller. Paper and labels may be fanfold or roll format.\nTag: C1 L10 TC

DIRECT THERMAL PRINTER IMAGING PROCESS\n\nDirect thermal printers have a heating element with heated pins that create an image directly onto special thermal paper.\n\n(https://4sorcero.s3.amazonaws.com/byteback/core_1/fig_core_1_515.png)\nDirect thermal print process.\n\nTHERMAL TRANSFER PRINTER MAINTENANCE TIPS\nThermal printers are often used in cash registers and for printing labels. Both of these uses require the printer to be available at all times, and to keep up availability, you should perform regular maintenance.\n\nWhen you are replacing the paper roll, you need to obtain the specific size and type for the brand and model of thermal printer you are using. The process is usually quite simple—just open the printer case, insert the roll, keeping the shiny print side facing outwards, then ensure that the end of the paper in held in place by the print head when closing the case again.\n\nIn receipt registers, the cashier rips the paper across the serrated teeth to give the receipt to the customer. This can lead to a build-up of paper dust in the printer from tearing off receipts. It can also lead to bits of paper debris becoming lodged in the mechanism if a clean slice is not made and bits of leftover paper fall into the printer.\n\nLabel printers can end up with sticky residue inside the printer. If labels are not loaded correctly, they can separate from the backing while being fed through the printer. You will need to ensure users know how to properly load the labels and how to clean up if labels get stuck inside the printer.\n\nUse a vacuum or soft brush to remove any paper debris. Use a swab and appropriate cleaning fluid, such as Isopropyl Alcohol (IPA), to clean the print head (heating element) or any sticky residue inhibiting the feed mechanism. Alternatively, you can often purchase cleaning cards to feed through the printer to clean the print head safely. Only use cleaning cards when required, though, as they can be abrasive and wear down components.\nTag: C1 L10 TC

3D PRINTERS\n\nA 3D print process builds a solid object from successive layers of material. The material is typically some sort of plastic but there are printer types that can work with rubber, carbon fiber, or metal alloys too. The range of materials that can be used is expanding quickly.\n\n3D printing has very different use cases to printing to paper. It is most widely used in manufacturing, especially to create "proof of concept" working models from designs. The range of other applications is growing, however. For example, 3D printing can be used in healthcare (dentistry and prosthetics), clothing, and to make product samples and other marketing material.\n\n(https://4sorcero.s3.amazonaws.com/byteback/core_1/fig_core_1_516.png)\nA 3D printer. (Image © 123RF.com.)\nTag: C1 L10 TC

3D PRINTER IMAGING PROCESS\n\nThe 3D printer imaging process begins with either a scan created by a 3D scanner or by creating an object using 3D modeling software. From either of these methods, you end up with a 3D model created in software and saved to a 3D model format.\n\nThis model is then sliced  with slicing software into horizontal layers. The slicing software might be contained in the 3D modeling software or within the 3D printer. The result is a print job specifying how each layer in the finished object is to be deposited.\n\nThe sliced model is then fed to the 3D printer over a USB or Wi-Fi connection, or by inserting an SD card containing the file into the printer. The printer then melts the filament and extrudes it onto the build surface, creating layer upon layer based on the slices. The extruder (and sometimes the build bed) is moved as needed on X/Y/Z axes to create the build.\nTag: C1 L10 TC

COMPONENTS OF 3D PRINTERS\n\nThere are several types of 3D printers. Fused filament fabrication (FFF), also known as fused deposition modeling (FDM), lays down layers of filament at high temperature. As layers are extruded, adjacent layers are allowed to cool and bond together before additional layers are added to the object. The main components in an FDM 3D printer are:\n• Print bed/build plate—a flat glass plate onto which the material is extruded. The bed is usually heated to prevent the material from warping. The bed must be leveled for each print job—this is usually automated, but cheaper printer models require manual calibration. It is very important that the printer frame be strong and rigid enough to keep the bed as stable as possible. Any vibration will result in poor quality printing.\n• Bed/build surface—a sheet placed onto the base plate to hold the object in position while printing, but also allow its removal on completion. The bed surface material may need to be matched to the filament material for best results.\n• Extruder—the equivalent of a print head in an inkjet. A motor in the extruder draws filament from the "cold end" through to the nozzle (or "hot end"), where it is melted and squirted onto the object. Different size nozzles can be fitted to the extruder.\n• Gears/motors/motion control—enable precise positioning of the extruder.\n• Fan—cools the melted plastic where necessary to shape the object correctly.\n\nThe printer must be installed to a suitable environment. A stable, vibration-free floor and dust-free, humidity-controlled surroundings will ensure best results.\n\nNote: 3D printing involves several possible safety risks. Components work at high temperatures, and use of sharp tools such as scrapers and finishing knives is required. Ideally, the 3D print facility should be accessible only to trained users.\n\nFILAMENT\nThe "ink" for a 3D printer is supplied as a spool of filament. Filament is provided either as 1.75 mm or 3 mm diameter. As noted earlier, there are various different filament materials. The two most popular plastics are Polylactic Acid (PLA) and Acrylonitrile Butadiene Styrene (ABS). Most printers can use a range of filament materials but it is best to check compatibility if a specific "exotic" is required for a project. Each material operates at different extruder and print bed temperatures.\n\nTo change a filament, the extruder must be heated to the appropriate temperature. Pull as much of the old filament out as possible—taking care not to burn yourself— then push the new filament through. Do not start printing until all of the old filament has been pushed out.\n\nFilament spools require careful storage once opened. They should be kept free from heat and humidity.\nTag: C1 L10 TC

3D PRINTER MAINTENANCE TIPS\n\n3D printers require maintenance specific to the type of printing done. These printers do not print on paper, so have very different maintenance needs and consumables than traditional printers. Among the maintenance tasks you need to perform are:\n• Remove any leftover filament from nozzles.\n• Clean any residual plastic from the platform, nozzles, and other areas. There could also be glue left on the glass if your print process uses glue.\n• If the documentation says to, apply grease to the moving parts that move the extruder on the X/Y/Z axes.\n• Check tubes in the feeder mechanism to see if they need to be cleaned or replaced.\n• Examine couplers to see if they have been damaged by the heat produced during the print process.\n• Make sure only approved materials are used when printing.\n• Check whether there are new versions of firmware available for the printer and whether you should apply them to the printer.\nTag: C1 L10 TC

OTHER 3D PRINTER TYPES\n\nThere are two other common types of rapid prototype 3D printing.\n\n(https://4sorcero.s3.amazonaws.com/byteback/core_1/table_core_1_518.png)\n\nSLA: Stereolithography (SLA) uses liquid plastic resin or photopolymer to create objects which are cured using an ultraviolet laser. Excess photopolymer is stored in a tank under the print bed. The print bed lowers into the tank as the object is created. A liquid solvent removes uncured polymer after the model is finished.\n\nSLS: Selective laser sintering (SLS) fuses layers together using a pulse laser. The object is created from a powder and lowered into a tank as each layer is added. The powder can be plastic or metal.\nTag: C1 L10 TC

Activity 10-3\nDiscussing Impact, Thermal, and 3D Printer Maintenance\n\nSCENARIO\nAnswer the following questions to check your understanding of the topic.\n\nQuestion 1. What type of printer technology is a dot matrix printer?\n\nAnswer 1. It is commonly described as an impact printer.\n\nQuestion 2. What types of paper/stationery can dot matrix printers use that laser and inkjet printers cannot?\n\nAnswer 2. Multi-part or continuous tractor-fed stationery and carbon copy paper.\n\nQuestion 3. Where are you must likely to encounter thermal printers?\n\nAnswer 3. Direct thermal printers are typically used as handheld receipt printers. There are other thermal printer types. For example, dye sublimation printers are often used for photo printing.\n\nQuestion 4. You have been asked to perform basic maintenance on a printer in the Research\nand Development area. The dot matrix printer used to create shipping documents seems to be printing lighter than normal, and one of the pins seems to not be connecting near the center of the print head as there are blank areas in some letters and images. What maintenance should you perform?\n\nAnswer 4. Using the steps in the printer documentation, replace the ribbon in the printer and clean the print head. If this does not fix the problem, replace the print head.\n\nQuestion 5.  A thermal printer used to create labels for parts bins, kits, and boxes is jammed due to a label coming loose during printing. How should you resolve this problem?\n\nAnswer 5. Open the printer and locate the label that came off the backing. Remove the label and if there is any sticky residue, clean it with isopropyl alcohol (IPA) applied to a swab. Ensure the roll of labels is properly loaded and that there are no loose labels that might come loose again.\nQuestion 6. What do you need to create objects with an FDM-type 3D printer?\n\nAnswer 6. You will need spools of filament, usually made of some type of plastic, to create 3D objects on a print bed or build surface.\n\nQuestion 7. What considerations for locating a 3D printer do you have to make?\n\nAnswer 7. The 3D print process is sensitive to movement and vibration, so the printer must be located on a firm and stable surface. The process can also be affected by dust and the ambient temperature and humidity (especially variations and drafts). Finally, some printer types are fully exposed so there is some risk of burns from the high-heat elements. Ideally, the printer should not be accessible to untrained staff.\nTag: C1 L10 TC A10-3

Topic D\nInstall and Configure Printers\n\nEXAM OBJECTIVES COVERED\n1001-3.10 Given a scenario, configure SOHO multifunction devices/printers and settings.\n1001-3.11 Given a scenario, install and maintain various print technologies.\n\nBecause printers are such a fundamental component of almost every computing environment, it is almost guaranteed that you will be asked to set up and configure printing on devices, no matter what professional environment you are working in. Although the different technologies used in various printer types affect maintenance and troubleshooting, the type of printer does not substantially affect the way it is installed and configured in an operating system such as Windows or shared on a network. The skills you will learn in this topic should prepare you to install and configure a wide range of printer types efficiently and correctly.\nTag: C1 L10 TD

WINDOWS PRINTERS\n\nWindows applications that support printing are typically WYSIWYG (What You See Is What You Get), which means that the screen and print output are supposed to be the same. To achieve this, several components are required:\n• The print driver provides an interface between the print device and Windows.\n• Support for one or more print languages determines how accurate the output can be.\n• The technology used by the printer determines the quality, speed, and cost of the explicitly called out in output.\n\nNote: There is a distinction between the software components that represent the printer and the physical printer itself. The software representation of the printer may be described as the "printer object," "logical printer," or simply "printer." Terms relating to the printer hardware include "print device" or "physical printer." Be aware that "printer" could mean either the physical print device or the software representation of that device. Pay attention to the context in which these terms are used.\nTag: C1 L10 TD

WINDOWS PRINT PROCESS\n\nDisplay and print functions for compatible applications are handled by the Windows Presentation Foundation (WPF) XML. A WPF print job is formatted and spooled as an Print Specification (XPS) file in the printer's spool folder (%SystemRoot%\\System32\\Spool\\Printers\\).\n\nThis spool file is then processed by the printer's device driver. It may either be output directly to an XPS-compatible print device or rendered using a different Page Description Language (PDL), such as HP Printer Control Language or Adobe® PostScript®, and converted to a raster, or dot-by-bot description of where the printer should place ink.\n\n(https://4sorcero.s3.amazonaws.com/byteback/core_1/fig_core_1_522.png)\nA print device might support more than one PDL—this HP printer supports both Printer Control Language (PCL) and PostScript (PS). (Screenshot used with permission from Microsoft.)\n\nThe print monitor transmits the print job to the printer and provides status information. Most print devices have their own memory and processor, enabling the print job to be transmitted more quickly and reliably. If a problem is encountered during printing, the print device sends a status message back to the print monitor, informing the user.\n\nApplications and print devices that do not support WPF use the older Graphics Device Interface (GDI) print process. Under GDI, the print file can be spooled in one of two formats:\n• EMF (Enhanced Metafile)—a small, efficient, printer-independent file type. As the file is smaller, it is written to disk more quickly, therefore freeing up resources. The printer must support EMF for this to work.\n• RAW—this file type differs depending on your printer. RAW files must be formatted for the printer at the spooling stage, therefore it will take longer to spool the file and the file will be larger. The RAW spool format is a useful troubleshooting tool.\n\nUsers can also print to network printers. In this case, a redirector service on the local computer passes the print job from the locally spooled file to the spooler on the print server (the computer to which the network printer is connected). Note that a driver for the network device must be installed locally.\n\nFEATURES OF PAGE DESCRIPTION LANGUAGES\nPDLs support the following features:\n• Scalable fonts—originally, characters were printed as bitmaps. This meant that the character could only be printed at sizes defined in the font (a bitmap font consists of a number of dot-by-dot images of each character at a particular font size). Scalable fonts are described by vectors. A vector font consists of a description of how each character should be drawn. This description can be scaled up or down to different font sizes. All Windows printers support scalable TrueType or OpenType fonts. OpenType is an extension of TrueType, developed jointly by Microsoft and\nAdobe. OpenType offers portability between Windows and Mac OS®, better character (Unicode) support, and more advanced typographic options. PostScript compatible printers will also support PostScript outline fonts.\n• Color printing—the color model used by display systems is different to that used by printers (additive versus subtractive). An additive model combines differently colored transmitted light (Red, Green, and Blue, for instance) to form different shades. A subtractive model works using the reflective properties of inks: Cyan, Magenta, and Yellow plus Black ink for "true" blacks. A color model provides an accurate translation between on-screen color and print output and ensures that different devices produce identical output.\n• Vector graphics—as with fonts, scalable images are built from vectors, which describe how a line should be drawn, rather than providing a pixel-by-pixel description, as is the case with bitmap graphics.\nTag: C1 L10 TD

VIRTUAL PRINTERS\n\nThere may be circumstances where you do not want to send a print job to a physical print device. Using a virtual printer means that the output is either a file containing instructions in some page description language or bitmap image data. Some of the reasons users might need to print to a virtual printer include:\n• Sending a document from their computer to a fax server.\n• Creating a document that cannot be purposely or inadvertently changed.\n• Making the document content available outside of the application which originally\ncreated the document.\n• Combining multiple documents into a single document.\n• Testing how the document will appear when printed on paper from a physical printer.\n\nWhen you are using a virtual print option, there may be a choice of file formats for the output:\n• Print to file—this creates a file that can subsequently be sent to the print device. It basically means saving a copy of the file that would normally be spooled by the printer. This may be used in conjunction with the PostScript print language. Note that the output files are typically very large.\n• Print to PDF—the Portable Document Format (PDF) was created by Adobe and later published as an open standard as a device-independent format for viewing and printing documents. Print (or export) to PDF functionality is available in many software applications.\n• Print to XPS—as noted earlier, the XML Print Specification is the print language supported by Windows. An XPS format file should be printable on modern Windows-compatible printers.\n• Print to image—some applications support directing the output to a bitmap image file format, such as PNG or JPEG. Vector text and art will be converted to a fixed resolution format.\n\n(https://4sorcero.s3.amazonaws.com/byteback/core_1/fig_core_1_524.png)\nWindows 10 includes Print to PDF and XPS Document Writer virtual printers by default. (Screenshot used with permission from Microsoft.)\n\nNote: The PC in the previous figure also has Adobe PDF, Send to OneNote, and SnagIt virtual printers installed.\nTag: C1 L10 TD

LOCAL PRINTER CONNECTIONS\n\nAs with other PC peripherals, USB is now the dominant printer interface.\n\nUSB PORTS\nTo install a USB printer, connect the device plug (usually a Type B connector) to the printer's USB port and the Type A host plug to a free port on the computer. In most cases, Windows will detect the printer using Plug-and-Play and install the driver automatically. You can confirm that the printer is successfully installed and print a test page using the Devices and Printers or Settings applet.\n\nEven though USB connections are powered, you will still need to connect the printer to mains power as it will draw down more power than USB can supply. Portable printers may have a battery supply.\n\nIn the following figure, notice that there is an option to print a test page. In the properties dialog box for the printer, you can see that the printer is connected via USB.\n\n(https://4sorcero.s3.amazonaws.com/byteback/core_1/fig_core_1_525.png)\nUsing Windows Settings to verify printer installation. (Screenshot used with permission from Microsoft.)\n\nETHERNET\nSome printers come equipped with a network adapter and RJ-45 port and can be connected directly to an Ethernet switch. Client devices can then either connect directly to the print device via its Internet Protocol (IP) address or the device can be managed and shared via a network print server.\n\nSERIAL PORT\nThe serial (RS-232 or COM) port is a legacy port and does not support the bandwidth required by modern desktop printers. Certain Point-of-Sale (PoS) barcode printers and older impact printers are interfaced by serial ports, however.\n\nConnect such a printer using an appropriate "null modem" serial cable; either 9-pin to 9-pin or 25-pin to 9-pin, depending on the printer model. Serial port drivers are unlikely to support Plug-and-Play, so you will need to complete the installation using the Device Setup wizard, selecting the appropriate COM port and driver. You may also need to configure custom COM port settings (via the Ports tab in the printer's property dialog box). Check the printer's setup guide for specific cable and connector requirements and installation procedures.\n\nWIRELESS PRINT DEVICE INTERFACES\nA cable-free connection to a printer offers a more flexible solution. Most wireless interfaces are built into the printer. Wi-Fi may be available as an installable upgrade. Another option is to connect a wireless print server via the printer's USB port. The two principal wireless printer interfaces are Bluetooth and Wi-Fi.\n\nBluetooth uses radio communications and supports speeds of up to 3 Mbps. It does not require line-of-sight and supports a maximum range of 10 m (30 feet), though signal strength will be very weak at this distance. To connect via Bluetooth, ensure that the printer is configured as discoverable, then use the Bluetooth applet in Control Panel or the Devices page in Windows Settings to add the device.\n\nWi-Fi (802.11) supports higher transfer rates. The printer should be configured with the appropriate WLAN settings (SSID and IP configuration) via its control panel. The main configuration choices are as follows:\n• 802.11 standard—the printer's wireless adapter will support a particular 802.11 standard (a, b, g, n, or ac). Other devices connecting to it must support the same standard and be configured with the same security settings.\n• Infrastructure versus ad-hoc—in infrastructure mode, the printer would be configured to connect to an access point and client connections would also be mediated by the access point. In ad-hoc mode, client devices would connect directly to the printer.\n\n(https://4sorcero.s3.amazonaws.com/byteback/core_1/fig_core_1_526.png)\nUsing the printer control panel to join a Wi-Fi network (infrastructure mode).\n\nAd-hoc is a specific mode of peer-to-peer connection associated with legacy standards (802.11a/b/g). You are more likely to encounter devices supporting Wi-Fi Direct/Wireless Direct. With Wi-Fi Direct, the server device supports a software-implemented access point to facilitate connections to client devices.\n\nOnce the Wi-Fi link is established, you should then be able to connect to the printer from Windows like any other network printer.\nTag: C1 L10 TD

PRINTER DRIVERS\n\nOperating system printer drivers must be installed for a printer to function correctly. If the device is not detected automatically, the printer port can be selected, and drivers can be installed using the Devices and Printers applet or the Windows Settings app.\n\n(https://4sorcero.s3.amazonaws.com/byteback/core_1/fig_core_1_527.png)\nAdd Printer Wizard—select a manual configuration if Windows does not detect the printer automatically. (Screenshot used with permission from Microsoft.)\n\nOnce the driver has been installed all applications will use it to send output to the printer. To test that the printer has installed correctly, open the Devices and Printers dialog box (right-click the printer icon in the applet) and select the Print Test  button on the Page General tab.\n\nNote: Installing a new driver requires elevation (UAC). On a domain network, administrators can install approved drivers to designated servers then use group policy to allow standard users to install local printers using those drivers.\n\nNote: Make sure you obtain a 32-bit or 64-bit driver as appropriate. Many older print devices have become unusable as the vendor has not developed a 64-bit driver for them. If no up-to-date driver is available from Microsoft, download the driver from the printer vendor's website, extract it to a folder on your PC, then use the Have Disk option to install it.\n\nCONFIGURATION SETTINGS\nPrint devices are configured and managed via the Devices and Printers folder (Windows 7 and 8) or the Settings app (Windows 10). The layout of these apps is <<<Configuration Settings>>> slightly different, but they present similar options—view the print queue, open properties and preferences, set a default printer, start a troubleshooter, and so on.\n\n(https://4sorcero.s3.amazonaws.com/byteback/core_1/fig_core_1_528.png)\nViewing the print queue and configuring preferences through the Printers and Scanners Settings app page. (Screenshot used with permission from Microsoft.)\n\nThere are two main configuration dialog boxes for a local printer: Printer Properties and Printing Preferences.\n\nNote: To adjust some device properties and options, you may have to select Run as administrator then Printer Properties or Printing Preferences as appropriate.\n\nPRINTER PROPERTIES\nA printer's Properties dialog box allows you to manage configuration settings for the printer object and the underlying hardware, such as updating the driver, printing to a different port, sharing and permissions, setting basic device options (such as whether a duplex unit is installed), and configuring default paper types for different feed trays.\n\nThe About tab contains information about the driver and the printer vendor and may include links to support and troubleshooting tips and utilities.\n\nNote: The options available for printing preferences and the layout of these dialog boxes is partly vendor-specific.\n\n(https://4sorcero.s3.amazonaws.com/byteback/core_1/fig_core_1_529a.png)\nThis HP printer allows defaults and installable options to be configured here. (Screenshot used with permission from Microsoft.)\n\nPRINTING PREFERENCES\nThe Preferences dialog box sets the default print job options, such as the type and orientation of paper or whether to print in color or black and white.\n\n(https://4sorcero.s3.amazonaws.com/byteback/core_1/fig_core_1_529b.png)\nThe shortcuts tab lets you select from preset option templates. (Screenshot used with permission from Microsoft.)\n\nThese settings can also be changed on a per-job basis by selecting the Properties button in the application's Print dialog box. Alternatively, the printer may come with management software that you can use to change settings.\n\nPAPER/QUALITY\nThe Paper/Quality tab allows you to choose the type of paper stock (size and type) to use and whether to use an economy or draft mode to preserve ink/toner. You can also use the Color tab to select between color and grayscale printing.\n\n(https://4sorcero.s3.amazonaws.com/byteback/core_1/fig_core_1_530.png)\nUse the Paper/Quality tab to configure the paper type and whether to use a reduced ink/toner economy mode. (Screenshot used with permission from Microsoft.)\n\nFINISHING\nThe Finishing tab lets you select output options such as whether to print on both sides of the paper (duplex), print multiple images per sheet, and/or print in portrait or landscape orientation.\n\n(https://4sorcero.s3.amazonaws.com/byteback/core_1/fig_core_1_531a.png)\nThe Finishing tab allows you to select duplex output (this printer allows only manual duplex, where the stack must be flipped by the user and reinserted into the paper tray manually). (Screenshot used with permission from Microsoft.)\n\nCOPY COUNT AND COLLATED PRINTS\nYou can change the copy count and collation options using the Advanced tab.\n\n(https://4sorcero.s3.amazonaws.com/byteback/core_1/fig_core_1_531a.png)\nPrint and collation options in Word. (Screenshot used with permission from Microsoft.)\n\nA collated print job is one where all pages of the first copy are printed, followed by all uncollated pages of the second copy, and so on. If the option is selected, then all copies of page 1 are printed first, followed by all copies of page 2, and so on.\nTag: C1 L10 TD

PRINTER SHARING AND NETWORKING\n\nThere are two main options for sharing a printer on the network:\n• Windows printer sharing\n• Hardware print server sharing\n\nWINDOWS PRINT SERVER CONFIGURATION\nAn administrator can share any locally installed printer via its Sharing tab in the Properties dialog box. Locally installed means that Windows communicates with the print device directly over the relevant port. It does not matter whether the port is wired (USB, serial, or Ethernet) or wireless (Bluetooth or Wi-Fi). Drivers for different operating systems can also be installed locally so that clients can obtain the appropriate driver when they connect to the print share.\n\n(https://4sorcero.s3.amazonaws.com/byteback/core_1/fig_core_1_532.png)\nSharing a printer via the Printer Properties dialog box. Use the Additional Drivers button from the Sharing page to install drivers for operating systems other than the host print server. (Screenshot used with permission from Microsoft.)\n\nNote: When you configure sharing, only one PC should be designated as the server for any one print device. If multiple PCs try to act as the server for the same print device, the result will be confusion.\n\nIf the network has clients running a mix of different operating systems, you need to consider how to make a printer driver available for each supported client. If the printer supports a "Type 3" driver, you need only add x86 (32-bit Windows) and/or x64 (64-bit Windows) support. For earlier "Type 2" drivers, each specific Windows version requires its own driver.\n\nNote: Windows 8 and 10 add support for Type 4 drivers. These are designed to move towards a print class driver framework, where a single driver will work with multiple devices. Where a specific print device driver is required, the client obtains it from Windows Update rather than the print server.\n\nSHARED PRINTER CONNECTIONS\nAn ordinary user can connect to a network printer (assuming that the printer administrator has given them permissions to use it). One way of doing this is to browse through the network resources using the Network object in File Explorer. Open the server computer hosting the printer, then right-click the required printer and select Connect.\n\n(https://4sorcero.s3.amazonaws.com/byteback/core_1/fig_core_1_533.png)\nConnecting to a network printer via File Explorer. (Screenshot used with permission from Microsoft.)\n\nINTEGRATED HARDWARE PRINT SERVERS/NAS\nSome printers come with integrated or embedded print server hardware and firmware, allowing client computers to connect to them over the network without having to go via a server computer. You can also purchase print servers or use a solution such as a Network Attached Storage (NAS) appliance that supports print sharing. Many wireless Internet routers can be configured to work as a NAS/print server solution.\n\n(https://4sorcero.s3.amazonaws.com/byteback/core_1/fig_core_1_534.png)\nInstalling a network printer using a vendor tool. The printer has been connected to the network via an Ethernet cable and been assigned an IP address by a DHCP server.\n\nNote: You can also purchase external print servers, such as HP's Jetdirect, that connect to a USB port on the printer and to the network via a standard port.\n\nIn place of a standard network card, a printer could be fitted with a Wi-Fi wireless adapter to make it available in a wireless network.\n\nA network printer needs to be configured so that it has a valid address. On an IP network, you might set the printer to obtain an address automatically via a Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) server or configure it with a static IP address and subnet mask. The printer will need to communicate with computers over one or more Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) or User Datagram Protocol (UDP) network ports. If a network connection cannot be established, verify that these ports are not being blocked by a firewall or other security software.\n\nMost printers provide a mechanism for locally configuring the printer. Usually, this is by means of a menu system which you navigate by using an LCD display and adjacent buttons or a touchscreen on the front of the printer.\n\n(https://4sorcero.s3.amazonaws.com/byteback/core_1/fig_core_1_535a.png)\nSetting the IP address configuration method via the printer's control panel.\n\nThis method is suitable for small office environments where you have few printers to manage. It is also useful in troubleshooting situations when the printer is inaccessible from the network. However, the printer vendor will usually supply a web-based utility to discover and manage their printers, whereas more advanced management suites are available for enterprise networks.\n\n(https://4sorcero.s3.amazonaws.com/byteback/core_1/fig_core_1_535b.png)\nManaging an HP printer using a browser.\n\nCLOUD AND REMOTE PRINTING\nA networked printer can also be made available over the web using the HyperText Transfer Protocol (HTTP) and Internet Printing Protocol (IPP). For example, on an HP printer, you can use the management console to enable web services. This allows users to print to the device via HP's ePrint Center using a specially configured print path for the printer (identified by an email address). Alternatively, you could use third-party software, such as Google's Cloud Print™, which can connect to cloud-ready printers or support cloud printing for legacy devices.\n\n(https://4sorcero.s3.amazonaws.com/byteback/core_1/fig_core_1_536.png)\nConfiguring ePrint web services on an HP printer.\n\nUsers can send documents to the printer by logging into the cloud service. There are apps to support mobile devices as well as PCs and laptops.\n\nBonjour/AirPrint\nYou may also want to configure a network printer to support clients other than Windows. One option is to enable the Bonjour service to allow macOS PCs and iOS mobile devices to connect by using Apple AirPrint.\n\n(https://4sorcero.s3.amazonaws.com/byteback/core_1/fig_core_1_537a.png)\nBonjour services have been configured on this printer allowing macOS and iOS devices to connect to it wirelessly (using Apple AirPrint).\n\nBonjour is the server part of the solution, while AirPrint provides the client connectivity. Through Bonjour, users can locate printers and file servers. It uses DNS service records to locate the devices offering print and file sharing services. AirPrint is part of the macOS and iOS operating systems and supported by most third-party applications and apps.\n\n(https://4sorcero.s3.amazonaws.com/byteback/core_1/fig_core_1_537b.png)\nThe printer can be used from iOS when connected to the same network.\n\nDATA PRIVACY AND SECURITY ISSUES\nYou should be aware of some of the data privacy and security issues exposed by\nshared printers:\n• Hard drive caching—most printers have a local storage device to use to cache print files. Someone with access to the device could be able to recover confidential information from the hard drive cache.\n• User authentication—it may be necessary to prevent unauthorized use of a network or cloud-based printer. In a Windows network, the permissions system can be used to control access to the printer. Cloud-based services can also be configured to require user authentication.\n• Data privacy—jobs sent over a network (such as via a cloud or remote print service) could potentially be intercepted and read, copied, or modified.\nTag: C1 L10 TD

Activity 10-4\nDiscussing Printer Installation and Configuration\n\nSCENARIO\nAnswer the following questions to check your understanding of the topic.\n\nQuestion 1. When you are purchasing a new printer, what would you need to decide between as you evaluate connections?\n\nAnswer 1. Almost all new printers use USB, so the main consideration would be whether you needed support for a wireless or Ethernet connection.\n\nQuestion 2. You use three Windows applications that need to print to a Canon BJC-4300 printer. How many printer drivers must you install?\n\nAnswer 2. One. Applications rely on the operating system to mediate access to devices. They do not need their own drivers.\n\nQuestion 3. You are setting up a print server and want to enable access for the widest range of Windows 7 machines possible. Should you install separate drivers for the Home and Enterprise editions?\n\nAnswer 3. No—there is no difference between editions in this regard. You do need to install drivers for x86 (32-bit) and x64 (64-bit) versions, though.\n\nQuestion 4. What tool can you use to confirm that basic print functionality is available?\n\nAnswer 4. Print a test page by using the option in the setup wizard or on the General tab of the Printer Properties dialog box.\n\nQuestion 5. You have installed an automatic duplex unit in an office laser printer. What configuration setting would you change to make the unit available for print jobs?\n\nAnswer 5. From Devices and Printers Settings or Printer Properties, select and then Device Settings Duplex Unit select the tab. Select the setting and select Installed.\n\nQuestion 6. True or false? When you print 10 copies of an uncollated job, 10 copies of page one are printed, followed by 10 copies of page two, then 10 copies of page three, and so on.\n\nAnswer 6. True.\n\nQuestion 7. True or false? To enable printer sharing via Windows, the print device must be connected to the Windows PC via an Ethernet or Wi-Fi link.\n\nAnswer 7. False—any print device can be shared via printer properties. The print device can be connected to the Windows print server over USB, Bluetooth, Ethernet, or Wi-Fi. Other clients connect to the printer via the share, however, so the Windows PC must be kept on to facilitate printing.\n\nQuestion 8. What configuration information does a user need to use a print device connected to the same local network?\n\nAnswer 8. The print device's IP address or host name. You might note that vendor utilities can search for a connected device on the local network, so "None" could also be a correct answer.\n\nQuestion 9. What service should a network print device run to enable an Apple iPad to\nuse the device over Wi-Fi?\n\nAnswer 9. The Bonjour service.\nTag: C1 L10 TD A10-4

Topic E\nTroubleshoot Print Device Issues\n\nEXAM OBJECTIVES COVERED\n1001-5.6 Given a scenario, troubleshoot printers.\n\nAs a support professional, you will be well aware that one of the most unpleasant problems for users is being unable to print. If users need hard copies of documents and the systems do not work, it can be very frustrating. Users will look to you to identify and resolve their problems quickly, so you will need to recognize common issues and to correct them efficiently when they occur.\nTag: C1 L10 TE

PRINTER CONNECTIVITY TROUBLESHOOTING\n\nPrinters are usually simple devices to troubleshoot, as in most cases there will be an error message or code displayed on the printer's control panel telling you exactly where the error lies. You may need to look the error code up in the printer documentation to confirm what it means. Use the error code to guide your troubleshooting efforts.\n\nUSING PRINTER LOGS\nYou could also check for multiple failed jobs in the print server's log. For example, in Windows, use Event Viewer to open the Applications and Services→Microsoft→Windows→Print Service→Operational log.\n\n(https://4sorcero.s3.amazonaws.com/byteback/core_1/fig_core_1_546.png)\nViewing print service informational messaging—any errors would appear here, too. (Screenshot used with permission from Microsoft.)\n\nNote:   You need to right-click to enable the Print Service—Operational log before it starts recording events. Consider creating an administrative alert for error events so that you can be warned of and investigate problems quickly.\n\nYou may also be able to collect error logs from the device itself. Management software will be able to retrieve these logs and report them to a centralized console. Alternatively, you can view them manually using a vendor-supplied tool, such as the management URL for this HP printer.\n\n(https://4sorcero.s3.amazonaws.com/byteback/core_1/fig_core_1_547.png)\nUsing a web management tool to view the event log for a print device.\n\nGENERAL TROUBLESHOOTING APPROACH\nIn the absence of any error code or descriptive error log, remember to test obvious things first:\n• Is the printer switched on and loaded with paper?\n• Is there sufficient ink or toner?\n• Is the connection between the printer and PC good?\n• Can you print a test page by using the printer's control panel and from within Windows?\n\nAlso check environmental conditions—a printer may malfunction if it overheats. Check that there is plenty of space around the printer for air to circulate (especially around the vents on the printer case) and that the environment is not excessively hot.\n\nRemember to ask: "What has changed?" It is important to establish whether something has never worked or has just stopped working. If something never worked, then there has been an installation error; if something has stopped working, look for a configuration change or maintenance issue.\n\nNote: Also remember that Windows has several built-in troubleshooting tools, one of which covers printer problems.\nTag: C1 L10 TE

GUIDELINES FOR TROUBLESHOOTING PRINT DEVICE ISSUES\n\nConsider these guidelines as you troubleshoot printing problems in Windows.\n\nNO IMAGE ON THE PRINTER DISPLAY\nIf there is no image on the printer display but the printer's power LED is lit:\n• Verify that the printer has not gone into a power-saving sleep cycle. Pressing the power button or pressing the touchscreen will generally wake the printer.\n• Try powering down the printer. Remove the power cord and any peripheral cables, and leave the printer switched off and unplugged for at least a minute. Then reconnect and restart the printer.\n• If these steps do not resolve the issue, there is likely to be a hardware fault.\n\nNO CONNECTIVITY\nIf documents do not print or if you see "Not available" messages relating to the printer you want to use:\n• Verify that the printer is switched on and "online." A printer can be taken offline quite easily by pressing the button on the control panel. Often this happens by accident. A printer may also go offline because it is waiting for user intervention or because it has received corrupt print job data.\n• Also check the connection between the host PC and printer. Make sure connectors are secure, that the network configuration is correct, or that there are no sources of interference blocking a wireless link, for instance.\n\nNote: Remember, cycling the power is a time-honored response to most troubleshooting scenarios involving end-user devices.\nTag: C1 L10 TE

PRINT QUEUE AND SPOOLER TROUBLESHOOTING\n\nA backed-up print queue means that there are lots of jobs pending but not printing. This might occur because the printer is offline or out of paper or ink/toner. It could also occur because of an error processing a particular print job. If a particular job will not print:\n\n• Open the Devices and Printers applet or Windows to access the printer Settings and open its print queue. Try restarting the job (right-click the document name and select Restart ). You need permission to Manage Documents on the printer object to restart or cancel jobs.\n• If that does not work, delete the print job and try printing it again.\n• Many problems, including "Low memory" or "Out of memory" errors, can also be solved by cycling the power on the printer and clearing a backed up print queue.\n\n(https://4sorcero.s3.amazonaws.com/byteback/core_1/fig_core_1_549a.png)\nUse the print queue to manage jobs—in this instance, you should be loading the printer with some paper, rather than trying to restart the print job. (Screenshot used with permission from Microsoft.)\n\nIf you cannot delete a job (if the print queue is backed up or stalled), you will need to stop the Print Spooler service.\n1. Open the Computer Management console, then expand Services and Applications  and select Services.\n\n(https://4sorcero.s3.amazonaws.com/byteback/core_1/fig_core_1_549b.png)\nManaging the spooler service using the Computer Management console. (Screenshot used with permission from Microsoft.)\n\n2. Right-click the Print Spooler service and select Stop.\n\n3. Use Explorer to delete the spooled file from %SystemRoot%\\System32\\Spool\\Printers. There will be a *.SPL file (the print job) and possibly a *.SHD file (status information), too.\n\n4. Start the Print Spooler service again.\n\nAlternatively, you can use net commands to manage the spooler service. Enter the commands net stop spooler and net start spooler in the Run dialog box or at a command prompt.\n\nAnother option is to try using different spool settings. Spool settings can be configured on the Advanced  tab of the Properties dialog box. You might want to change these settings if there are problems spooling jobs. This page also lets you set the spooled file type between EMF and RAW (select Print Processor). In the Printer Properties dialog box, change the spool settings as follows, testing after each change:\n• Change the spool data format to RAW.\n• Turn off spooling (select Print directly to printer).\n\nAlso verify that there is plenty of free disk space on the volume hosting the spooler.\n\n(https://4sorcero.s3.amazonaws.com/byteback/core_1/fig_core_1_550.png)\nSpool and Print Processor settings in Printer Properties.\nTag: C1 L10 TE

PERMISSION ISSUES TROUBLESHOOTING\n\nThere are several scenarios where permission issues can affect a user's ability to print\ndocuments.\n\nACCESS DENIED\nIf a user is accessing a printer that has been shared over a network, an Access Denied message means that the user account has not been configured with permission to print documents. Add the user to the relevant security group (or add the relevant security group or user object to the printer).\n\n(https://4sorcero.s3.amazonaws.com/byteback/core_1/fig_core_1_550.png)\nConfigure print device permissions on the Security tab in the Printer Properties dialog box.\n\nIf the permissions are correct, verify that security software is not causing a problem by trying to scan the spool folder, and verify the permissions on the spool folder itself. You might also investigate the disk hosting the printer spool to ensure there is no problem there.\n\nUNABLE TO INSTALL PRINTER\nIf a user cannot install a printer, it is likely to be because their account does not have sufficient permissions to install the printer driver. This sort of operation will normally have to be performed by an administrator, though it is possible to configure network security policies that allow users to install printers with signed drivers.\n\nIf the problem is not related to permissions, verify that you are attempting to install a driver for the correct version and type of Windows. In particular, remember that 32-bit printer drivers will not work with a 64-bit edition of Windows.\n\nAlso verify that the print spooler service is started.\n\nNote: There's also the possibility that existing printer drivers are interfering with the one you're trying to install. Uninstall these other drivers, then try installing the new one. If you need these older drivers for other printers, try removing them from the default printer status, then install the new printer driver as the default.\nTag: C1 L10 TE

DRIVER AND GARBLED OUTPUT ISSUES\n\nIf a print job contains high-resolution graphics or multiple pages and printing is very slow, bear in mind that the printer may not have sufficient resources to handle the job and may display an error such as Low memory or Out of memory.\n• Try clearing the print queue and sending the job again or cycling power on the printer.\n• If there are persistent problems with printing from a specific application, check the vendor's troubleshooting website to determine if a driver update will fix the problem.\n\nUse the printer's property sheet to print a test page. If the test page prints successfully, then the problem is related to the print function of a particular application. Try printing a different file from the same application; if this works, then you know that the problem is specific to a particular file. If the test page does not print, try using the printer's control panel to print it. If this works, there is some sort of communication problem between the print device and Windows.\n\nOne of the first options when trying to remedy most types of software print problem is to update the driver to the latest version or use a different driver (PostScript instead of PCL, for instance). Also check that the correct job options have been set (media type, input tray, duplex printing, monochrome or color, economy mode, and so on). Remember that print properties set through the application (by selecting File→Print Properties→Print Setup) override those set as the default (either through the Printer object in Windows or through the device's control panel).\n\nIf a print job is garbage (if it emits many pages with a few characters on each or many\nblank pages):\n1. Cancel the print job.\n2. Clear the print queue.\n3. Cycle the power on the printer (leaving it off for 30 seconds to clear the memory).\n4. Try to print again.\n\nIf the problem persists, update the printer driver and check that the printer is set to use the correct control language (PCL or PostScript). You can also try changing the spool type from EMF to RAW or disabling spooling.\n\nIf printing is slow, use the Advanced property page to choose the Start printing immediately option. You can try changing the spool format from RAW to EMF.\n\nIf the characters in a document are different from those expected or if strange characters appear in an otherwise normal print, check that fonts specified in the document are available on the PC and/or printer. The software application should indicate whether the specified font is available or whether it is substituting it for the nearest match.\n\nTo view fonts installed on the computer, open the Fonts applet in Control Panel/Windows Settings. Each font family (such as Arial) often comes with a number of variants (such as Bold or Italic). If you open a font icon, a preview of the font at different sizes is shown.

GENERAL PRINT DEFECT RESOLUTION\n\nIf a job prints from Windows but the output is smudged, faded, or arrives with unusual marks (print defects), the problem is likely to be a printer hardware or media fault. This section describes some of the common faults likely to be encountered. Always consult the manufacturer's documentation and troubleshooting notes.\n\nNote: Working inside any electrical equipment, especially a laser printer, can be dangerous. If the cause of a problem is not easily found, you must seek advice from a qualified source. You should never defeat a safety interlock in order to operate a printer with protective covers removed.\n\nA paper jam is one of the most frequently occurring printer problems.\n\nFixing a paper jam is usually quite straightforward. The key point is to gain proper access to the stuck page. Do not use force to try to remove a sheet as you may cause further damage. Most sheets will pull free from most parts of the printer, but if a page is stuck in the fuser unit of a laser printer, you must use the release levers to get it out. Pulling the paper forcibly through the fuser can damage the rollers and, if the paper rips, leave paper debris on them.\n\nIf paper jams are frequent, you need to diagnose the problem, rather than simply fix the symptom each time. Most paper jams arise because the media (paper or labels) are not suitable for the printer or because a sheet is creased, folded, or not loaded properly in the tray. There could be a problem with a roller, too. Identify whether or not the jam occurs in the same place each time, and take appropriate preventive maintenance (clean or replace the part).\n\n(https://4sorcero.s3.amazonaws.com/byteback/core_1/fig_core_1_554.png)\nThe printer control panel should identify the location of the paper jam.\n\nIf paper is not feeding into the printer or if the printer is feeding multiple sheets at the same time, verify that it is loaded in the tray properly and that it is of an appropriate weight (not too thick or thin). If you can discount a media problem, try changing the pickup rollers. In a laser printer, these are part of the maintenance kit.\n\nNote: Fan the edge of a paper stack with your thumb to separate the sheets before loading the tray. Do not overdo this however—you can generate a static charge that will hold the sheets together.\nTag: C1 L10 TE

LASER PRINTER PRINT DEFECTS\n\nThe causes of print defects tend to be specific to the technology used by the imaging process. The following defects are common in laser printers:\n• Faded or faint prints—if a simple cause such as the user choosing an option for low density (draft output) can be discounted, this is most likely to indicate that the toner cartridge needs replacing.\n• Blank pages—as noted earlier, this is usually an application or driver problem, but it could indicate that a toner cartridge has been installed without removing its packing seals. Alternatively, if these simple causes can be discounted, this could also be a sign that the transfer roller (or secondary corona wire) is damaged (the image transfer stage fails).\n• Skewed output—verify that the paper is inserted correctly and that media guides are well-positioned (not too tight and not too loose).\n• White stripes—this indicates either that the toner is poorly distributed (give the cartridge a gentle shake) or that the transfer roller is dirty or damaged.\n• Black stripes or whole page black—indicates that the primary transfer roller is dirty or damaged or that the High Voltage Power Supply to the developer unit is malfunctioning.\n• Toner specks—if the output is "speckled," loose toner may be getting onto the paper. Clean the inside of the printer using an approved toner vacuum.\n• Persistent marks—streaks, vertical or horizontal lines, and other marks that appear in the same place (referred to as repetitive defects) are often due to dirty feed rollers (note that there are rollers in the toner cartridge and fuser unit, too) or a damaged or dirty photosensitive drum.\n• Toner not fused to paper—if the output smudges easily, this indicates that the fuser needs replacing.\n• Wavy or wrinkled output—make sure the paper is inserted correctly (try turning the stack over).\n• Ghost images—this is a sign that the photosensitive drum has not been cleaned properly. The drum is smaller than the size of a sheet of paper, so if the image is not completely cleared it will repeat as a light "ghost" or dark "shadow" image farther down the page. Images may also appear from previous prints. Try printing a series of different images and see if the problem resolves itself. If not, replace the drum/toner cartridge.\n• Wrong color/color cast—if prints come out in the wrong color (for example, if the whole print has a magenta tint), ensure that the toner cartridges have been installed in the correct location (for instance, that a Magenta cartridge hasn't been installed in the Cyan slot). Also ensure that there is sufficient toner in each cartridge. If there is a cast or shadow-like effect, one or all of the cartridges, rollers, or transfer belt are probably misaligned. Try reseating them and then run the printer calibration utility, and print a test page to verify the problem is solved.\n• Color missing—if a color is completely missing, try replacing the cartridge. If this does not solve the issue, clean the contacts between the printer and cartridge.\n• Paper jams—if the media and pickup rollers are good and if the jam occurs within the drum assembly but before the image is fused, the cause could be a faulty Static Eliminator Strip. Normally, this removes the high static charge from the paper as it leaves the transfer unit. If the strip fails, the paper may stick to the drum or curl as it enters the fuser unit.\nTag: C1 L10 TE

INKJET AND DOT MATRIX PRINT DEFECTS\n\nDefects in inkjet and dot matrix output tend to be concentrated around print head and media issues.\n\nINKJET PRINTERS\nLines running through printouts indicate a dirty print head or blocked ink nozzle, which can usually be fixed by running a cleaning cycle. Most other print quality problems (output that smears easily, wavy or wrinkled output, or blurry output) is likely to be a media problem. As with laser printers, persistent marks on output probably indicate a dirty feed roller. If the print head jams, the printer will probably display a status message or show a flashing LED. Try turning the printer off and unplugging it then turning it back on. Inconsistent color output indicates that one of the ink reservoirs is running low (or that a print head for one of the color cartridges is completely blocked). If a document does not print in color, check that color printing has actually been selected.\n\nDOT MATRIX PRINTERS\nLines in the output indicate a stuck pin in the print head. Output can also be affected by the platen position. The platen adjusts the gap between the paper and the print head to accommodate different paper types. Incorrect adjustment of the platen gap can cause faint printing (gap too wide) or smudging (too narrow). On more sophisticated printers, the platen gap is adjusted automatically. Use an Isopropyl Alcohol solution to clean the print head if necessary.\nTag: C1 L10 TE

Activity 10-6\nTroubleshooting Printer Issues\n\nSCENARIO\nAnswer the following questions to check your understanding of the topic.\n\nQuestion 1.\nA user reports that the printed output is not up to the usual standards for her\nprinter. You will need to resolve this issue so she can print her report.\nWhat is the overall process for troubleshooting this issue?\nPrint out a test page to see if you can reproduce the problem the user reported.\nIf you see the same problem as reported by the user, identify the print defect,\nbased on the type of printer, to resolve the problem. Document the steps you\ntook to resolve the problem.\n\nQuestion 2.\nIf print jobs do not appear at the printer and the queue is clear, what could\nyou try first to solve the problem?\nCycle the power on the printer.\n\nQuestion 3. Where on disk is the print file spooled in Windows?\n%SystemRoot%\\System32\\Spool\\Printers\n<<<.>>>\n\nQuestion 4. You need to restart the Print Spooler service on a Windows 7 machine. You have logged on as Administrator. What are your next steps?\n\nRight-click and select Computer Manage Services. Select Applications Services→Print Spooler. Right-click and select Restart.\n\nQuestion 5. How would you track down the source of a paper jam?\n\nCheck the error message reported by the printer (this may be shown on the printer's console). It may indicate the location of the stuck pages. Otherwise, visually inspect the various feed and output mechanisms.\n\nQuestion 6. What should you do if you cannot delete a job stuck in the print queue?\n\nStop the print spooler service, delete the spooled file, then restart the spooler.\n\nQuestion 7. Paper is jamming in an inkjet printer. What could be causing this?\n\nThe paper might not be loaded squarely, there might be too much paper loaded into the tray, or the paper is creased or dirty.\n\nQuestion 8. What effect does a worn photosensitive drum have on printing?\n\nFaint printing.\n\nQuestion 9. A laser printer is producing white stripes on the paper. What could be causing this?\n\nPoorly distributed toner or a damaged/worn transfer corona wire. If the secondary corona does not apply a charge evenly across the paper, less toner is attracted from the drum to the part of the sheet where charging failed. Note that if there are repetitive white or black marks (rather than stripes) that do not smudge, the issue is more likely to be dirt or grease on the drum.\n\nQuestion 10. What effect does a dirty primary corona wire have on laser printing?\n\nIt leaves black stripes on the paper. If the charging corona does not apply the correct charge evenly to the drum, toner is attracted to the place where the charging failed, creating a black stripe all the way down the page.\nTag: C1 L10 TE A10-6

Topic F\nInstall and Configure Imaging Devices\n\nEXAM OBJECTIVES COVERED\n1001-3.6 Explain the purposes and uses of various peripheral types.\n\nPrinters are used to create output from a variety of sources. Some of those sources take the form of copying physical documents and photos. Another source might be from a barcode. Some printers include features that allow you to copy or scan an item to bring it into the computer as a file, or to take it directly from the source to output from the printer. In this topic, you will look at a variety of scanning devices.\nTag: C1 L10 TF

IMAGING DEVICES\n\nIn a previous lesson, you learned about some imaging devices such as digital cameras and webcams. Another type of imaging device is scanners.\nTag: C1 L10 TF

SCANNERS\n\nA scanner is a digital imaging device, designed to create computer file data from a real-life object. Typically, scanners handle flat objects, like documents, receipts, or photographs. Optical Character Recognition (OCR) software can be used to convert scanned text into digital documents, ready for editing. Historically, scanners could be connected using the parallel port or via a SCSI bus. Nowadays, scanners are connected via USB or via an Ethernet network port (RJ-45) or wireless (Wi-Fi/802.11) network.\nTag: C1 L10 TF

FLATBED SCANNERS\n\nA flatbed scanner works by shining a bright light, usually from a Cold Cathode Fluorescent Lamp (CCFL), at the object, which is placed on a protective glass surface. A system of mirrors reflects the illuminated image of the object onto a lens. The lens either uses a prism to split the image into its component colors (Red, Green, and Blue) or focuses it onto imaging sensors coated with different color filters.\n\nThere are two main types of imaging sensor: Charge Coupled Device (CCD) and Complementary Metal Oxide Semiconductor (CMOS) . Most flatbed scanners use CCD-type sensors.\n\n(https://4sorcero.s3.amazonaws.com/byteback/core_1/fig_core_1_560.png)\nA flatbed scanner. (Image © 123RF.com.)\nTag: C1 L10 TF

SHEET-FED AND ADF SCANNERS\n\nContact Image Sensor (CIS)-based scanners use an array of LEDs (Light Emitting Diodes) that strobe between red, green, and blue light to illuminate the image. This is reflected via a rod-shaped lens onto an image sensor. CIS scanners are typically used in Sheet-Fed and ADF. In a sheet-fed scanner or the scan component of an Automatic Document Feeder (ADF), rather than passing the scan head under the paper, the paper is passed over a fixed scan head.\n\nThis design is much more compact and often used in "all-in-one" type MultiFunction Devices (MFDs).\nTag: C1 L10 TF

MULTI-FUNCTION DEVICES\n\nA multi-function device (MFD) is a piece of office equipment that performs the functions of a number of other specialized devices. MFDs typically include the <<<Multi-Function Devices>>> functions of a printer, scanner, fax machine, and copier. However, there are MFDs that do not include fax functions. Although the multi-function device might not equal the performance or feature sets of the dedicated devices it replaces, multi-function devices are very powerful and can perform most tasks adequately and are an economical and popular choice for most home or small-office needs.\n\n(https://4sorcero.s3.amazonaws.com/byteback/core_1/fig_core_1_560b.png)\nAn MFD.

SCAN OPTIONS\n\nWhen the scanner has been connected to the PC and configured by Plug-and-Play, it should become available to applications that can use the scan interface. Older scanners use TWAIN-based software; modern scanners are more likely to use Windows Image Acquisition (WIA). The software will present options for the image output format (PDF or JPEG, for instance) and tools for selecting and correcting the image. Another option may be to use Optical Character Recognition (OCR) software to convert a text image into a computer-editable text document.\n\n(https://4sorcero.s3.amazonaws.com/byteback/core_1/fig_core_1_561.png)\nHP Scan image acquisition software.\n\nSome scanners have the options available directly on the printer to specify what format to scan the item as, the resolution, and other options.\nTag: C1 L10 TF

BARCODE SCANNERS\n\nA barcode scanner is a handheld or pen-shaped device designed to scan barcodes. A barcode is a pattern of different sized parallel bars, typically representing a product number, such as an ISBN, IAN/EAN, or UPC. The reader uses a sensor mechanism (one of a photo diode, laser, or CCD) to read the intensity of light reflected back by the barcode. The reader then reports the number back to application software, which links it to a product database. Barcode scanners are connected to a computer using a USB port.\n\n(https://4sorcero.s3.amazonaws.com/byteback/core_1/fig_core_1_562a.png)\nAn example of a barcode scanner.

QR SCANNERS\n\nQuick Response (QR) codes are a particular type of 2D barcode that have been widely adopted for consumer-oriented uses. A QR code can be scanned using a smart phone camera, a normal digital camera, or webcam. There is no need to install special barcode scanning hardware. QR code scanning software can identify a QR code image directly from the camera and initiate the appropriate response in software to the information contained in the QR code. This might be to open a website or import a contact record or calendar event.\n\nNote: Actually, a camera can be used to scan any type of barcode if the software to\nidentify and interpret the barcode is available.\n\n(https://4sorcero.s3.amazonaws.com/byteback/core_1/fig_core_1_562b.png)\nAn example of a QR code you can scan with a QR scanner installed on your smart phone.\nTag: C1 L10 TF

Activity 10-8\nDiscussing Imaging Device Installation and Configuration\n\nSCENARIO\nAnswer the following questions to check your understanding of the topic.\n\nQuestion 1. What type of connection interface is a scanner most likely to use?\n\nAll modern scanners will support USB. Some might have an Ethernet network port (RJ-45) or even wireless (Wi-Fi and/or Bluetooth), though this is more typical of Multifunction Devices (MFD) than standalone scanners.\n\nQuestion 2. What type of sensor is used to capture an image for conversion to a digital file?\n \nCharge Coupled Device (CCD) or Complementary Metal Oxide Semiconductor (CMOS).\n\nQuestion 3. What is the function of OCR?\n\nOptical Character Recognition (OCR) software can convert a scanned image of text into a digital text file that can be edited in a text editor or word processor.\n\nQuestion 4. What type of imaging input device would be most useful for a Point-of-Sale (POS) system?\n\nBarcode scanner.\n\nQuestion 5. True or false? Any type of smartphone camera can be used to read a QR code.\n\nTrue. The smartphone just needs to capture the image of the Quick Response (QR) code and be installed with software to decode it.\nTag: C1 L10 TF A10-8
