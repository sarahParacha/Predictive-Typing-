In this topic, you will focus on features that distinguish different laptop models and laptops from desktop computers.\nTag: C1 L8 TA

LAPTOPS\n\nA laptop is a complete portable computer system. Laptops have specialized hardware designed especially for use in a portable chassis and can run on battery or AC power. Laptops use the same sort of operating systems as desktop PCs, however, and have many upgradeable or replaceable components.\n\n(https://4sorcero.s3.amazonaws.com/byteback/core_1/fig_core_1_418.png)\nDistinctive features of a laptop computer, including the built-in screen, integrated keyboard, touchpad pointer control, and I/O ports (on both sides and rear of chassis). (Image © 123RF.com.)\n\nLike desktops, laptops come in many different models and specifications. You could broadly categorize laptops as follows:\n• Entry Level/Budget—basic model (often with home or business versions) featuring average components and a trade-off between features and portability.\n• Ultraportable—very small and light machines offering extended operating time on battery power. The trade-off here is smaller screen size, lower capacity drives, and fewer peripherals.\n• Desktop Replacement—a powerful machine with similar performance, capacity, and peripherals to a desktop PC. The trade-off is that these machines are less portable and less able to run for long on battery power.\n• Media Center—portable home entertainment systems, featuring large screens, storage capacity, media features (such as TV tuner, video recording, and surround sound), and components capable of running the latest games.\n• Gaming Laptop—an increasingly popular class of machine. ATI and NVIDIA are producing more graphics adapters designed for laptops, though they cannot quite match the power of desktops built for gaming.\n\nAlthough laptops can use peripheral devices, the basic input and output devices are provided as integrated components.\nTag: C1 L8 TA

TOUCHPADS\n\nAlmost all laptops use   as the primary pointing device. Moving a finger over the touch-sensitive pad moves the cursor and tapping it issues a click. Touchpads also come with buttons and scroll areas to replicate the function of a mouse's scroll wheel. Most touchpads now support multi-touch or using gestures, such as a pinch to zoom the display.\n\n(https://4sorcero.s3.amazonaws.com/byteback/core_1/fig_core_1_419.png)\nThe Mouse applet in Control Panel allows you to configure both mice and touchpads—installing the vendor's driver makes extra configuration settings available.\n\nIn Windows®, the touchpad can be configured using the Mouse applet in Control Panel. Installing the manufacturer's driver will make the device-specific options available, such as configuring scroll areas or gesture support.\n\nNote: When you are using a touchpad, it is easy to brush the pad accidentally and for this to be interpreted as a click event. If this happens a lot, adjust the sensitivity setting or completely disable the Tap to click functionality.\nTag: C1 L8 TA

KEYBOARDS\n\nApart from being flatter and more compact, a laptop keyboard is similar to a desktop keyboard. The main difference is the Function (Fn) keys operate using the Fn key with the top row of numerals.\n\nNote: Actually, many desktop keyboards also include function keys to support use as an external keyboard for a laptop. If not being used with a laptop, these keys can be mapped to perform different functions.\n\n(https://4sorcero.s3.amazonaws.com/byteback/core_1/fig_core_1_420.png)\nA laptop keyboard with function and media control keys across the top.\n\nThese Function (Fn) keys perform laptop-specific functions indicated by distinctive icons. Typical functions include:\n• Display—toggle the video feed between the built-in laptop display, the built-in display and an external monitor (dual display), and an external monitor only.\n• Screen orientation—some tablet/laptop hybrids have rotatable screens while others can be used in tablet mode and can switch the screen orientation automatically between portrait and landscape modes depending on how the device is being held. A screen orientation function key will allow you to choose whether to lock the screen in one orientation.\n• Wireless/Bluetooth/Cellular/GPS—toggle the radio for Wi-Fi, Bluetooth , cellular  data, and/or Global Positioning System (GPS) on and off. Each of these settings might be separately configurable or be selectively disabled via different toggle states and indicators. There is often an airplane mode toggle to completely disable all wireless functions.\n• Volume—adjust the sound up, down, or off (mute).\n• Screen brightness—dim or brighten the built-in display.\n• Keyboard backlight—illuminate the keys (useful for typing in low light).\n• Touchpad—sometimes the touchpad can interfere with typing, causing the cursor to jump around. A touchpad toggle allows you to enable or disable it as required.\n• Media options—this allows control over audio and video playback, such as stop, pause, fast forward, and rewind controls, or skipping between tracks.\n\nDepending on the size of the chassis, a laptop keyboard may not support a numeric keypad. In this case, some of the ordinary keys may function as a keypad in conjunction with NumLock or the Fn key.\n\nNote: One issue to watch out for in laptop keyboards and chassis designs is flex, where the board buckles slightly when keys are pressed. None of the input devices on a laptop are really suitable for sustained use. An external keyboard and/or mouse can of course be connected using a USB or wireless port.\n\nCONFIGURATION OF KEYBOARD SETTINGS\nIn Windows, you use the Keyboard applet in Control Panel or Windows Settings to configure options such as the repeat rate and sensitivity for keys. The vendor driver may make additional settings available for configuring function keys.\n\n(https://4sorcero.s3.amazonaws.com/byteback/core_1/fig_core_1_421.png)\nLogitech SetPoint software for configuring programmable keys and hot keys.\nTag: C1 L8 TA

DISPLAYS AND TOUCHSCREENS\n\nMost modern laptop displays are also touchscreens of one kind or another. Some can be used with a stylus as well as (or instead of) finger touch.\n\nAnother important point to note about the laptop display screen is that it holds the antenna wires for the Wi-Fi adapter. These are connected to the adapter via internal wiring.\n\nROTATING OR REMOVABLE SCREENS\nSome laptops are based on tablet hybrid form factors where the touchscreen display can be fully flipped or rotated between portrait and landscape orientations. Another approach, used on Microsoft's Surface  tablets, is for the keyboard portion of the laptop to be detachable and for the screen to work independently as a tablet.\n\nNote: In Windows 10, tablet mode for the Start Screen is selected automatically (by default) on hybrid devices. For example, removing the keyboard from a Microsoft Surface tablet or folding the screen of an HP X360 device over through 360 degrees puts Windows 10 into tablet mode. You can use Windows 10 settings to manually select tablet mode and to configure these automatic behaviors.\n\nTOUCHSCREEN CONFIGURATION\nIn Windows, touchscreen options are configured using the Tablet PC Settings Pen and and Touch applets.\n\n(https://4sorcero.s3.amazonaws.com/byteback/core_1/fig_core_1_422.png)\nUse the Tablet PC Control Panel applet to set up or calibrate a touchscreen. (Screenshot used with permission from Microsoft.)\n\nYou can use Tablet PC Settings to calibrate the display and set options for orientation and left- or right-handed use, and you can use Pen and Touch to configure gesture settings, such as using tap-and-hold to trigger a right-mouse click event.\nTag: C1 L8 TA

EXPANSION OPTIONS\n\nLaptops ship with standard wired ports for connectivity. The ports are usually arranged on the left and right edges. Older laptops might have ports at the back of the chassis. There will be at least one video port for an external display device, typically HDMI or DisplayPort/Thunderbolt, but possibly VGA or DVI on older laptops. There will also be a number of USB Type A ports and one or more USB Type C ports on a modern laptop, one of which may also function as a Thunderbolt port.\n\nOther standard ports include microphone and speaker jacks and RJ-45 (Ethernet) for networking. Finally, a laptop might come with a memory card reader.\n\nUSB provides a simple means of adding or upgrading an adapter without having to open the laptop chassis. USB adapters (or "dongles") can provide a wide range of functionality:\n• USB to RJ-45—provide an Ethernet port for a laptop or mobile device. Ultrathin laptops often omit a built-in RJ-45 port as it is too tall to fit in the chassis.\n\n(https://4sorcero.s3.amazonaws.com/byteback/core_1/fig_core_1_423a.png)\nUSB to Ethernet adapter. (Image © 123RF.com.)\n\n• USB to Wi-Fi/Bluetooth—this might be used to upgrade to a better Wi-Fi standard than the laptop's built-in adapter. Most dongles will also function as a Bluetooth adapter. Some Wi-Fi dongles are compact but those lacking large antennas may not perform well; the drawback of large antennas is, of course, that they protrude significantly.\n• USB Optical Drive—most ultraportable laptops no longer feature optical drives as they cannot fit within the ultrathin chassis.\nTag: C1 L8 TA

PORT REPLICATORS\n\nA port replicator usually attaches to a special connector on the back or underside of a portable computer. It provides a full complement of ports for devices such as keyboards, monitors, mice, and network connections. A replicator does not normally add any other functionality to the portable computer.\n\n(https://4sorcero.s3.amazonaws.com/byteback/core_1/fig_core_1_423b.png)\nA port replicator. (Image by Elnur Amikishiyev © 123RF.com.)\nTag: C1 L8 TA

DOCKING STATIONS\n\nA docking station is a sophisticated port replicator that may support add-in cards or drives via a media bay. When docked, a portable computer can function like a desktop machine or use additional features, such as a full size expansion card.\n\n(https://4sorcero.s3.amazonaws.com/byteback/core_1/fig_core_1_424a.png)\nA laptop docking station. (Image by Luca Lorenzelli © 123RF.com.)\n\nNote: Most port replicators and docking stations use proprietary connectors. There are USB versions but their performance can be a bit erratic.\n\nPHYSICAL LOCKS\nBeing so portable makes laptops easy devices to steal. Many cable locks are available to chain the laptop to a desk. These are typically either key or combination operated. If key operated, make sure you record the key code in case you need to get a replacement.\n\n(https://4sorcero.s3.amazonaws.com/byteback/core_1/fig_core_1_424b.png)\nKensington laptop locks. (Image by © 123RF.com.)\n\nMost laptops come with a connection point for a Kensington lock in the chassis.\nTag: C1 L8 TA

Activity 8-1\nDiscussing Laptop Features\n\nSCENARIO\nAnswer the following questions to check your understanding of the topic.\n\nQuestion 1. What feature would you expect to find on a modern touchpad, compared to older models?\n\nAnswer 2. Support for multi-touch.\n\nQuestion 2. True or false? Touchpad settings would be configured via the Touch applet in Windows Control Panel.\n\nAnswer 2. False—the touchpad is configured via tabs in the Mouse applet.\n\nQuestion 3.

Screen brightness, and toggling the output between the built-in screen and external ports.\n\nQuestion 4. What device would you use to extend the functionality of a laptop while sitting at a desk?\n\nAnswer 4. A docking station is used to extend functionality (allowing use of additional drives or adapters) but you could also mention a port replicator, which extends the number of connectivity options.\n\nQuestion 5. What connectivity issue is resolved by providing a USB-to-RJ-45 dongle?\n\nAnswer 5. Ethernet/wired network connectivity.\n\nQuestion 6. What is the brand name of the standard cable lock security system for laptops?\n\nAnswer 6. Kensington.\nTag: C1 L8 TA A8-1

Topic B\nInstall and Configure Laptop Hardware\n\nEXAM OBJECTIVES COVERED\n1001-1.1 Given a scenario, install and configure laptop hardware and components.\n1001-1.2 Given a scenario, install components within the display of a laptop.\n1001-5.5 Given a scenario, troubleshoot common mobile device issues while adhering to the appropriate procedures.\n\nThere will be situations where dealing with external components won't completely address the issues or problems a user is having with his or her laptop. You will need to be able to install and configure internal laptop hardware components.\nTag: C1 L8 TB

LAPTOP DISASSEMBLY PROCESSES\n\nWhen it comes to performing upgrades or replacing parts, there are some issues specific to laptops that you should be aware of.\n\nNote: Only open a laptop to access internal components if it is no longer under warranty or if you are an authorized technician for the laptop brand.\n\nHAND TOOLS AND PARTS\nLaptops use smaller screws than are found on desktops. You may find it useful to obtain a set of jeweler's screwdrivers and other appropriate hand tools. It is also much easier to strip the screws—remove the notch for the screwdriver—take care and use an appropriately sized screwdriver!\n\nYou need to document the location of screws of a specific size and the location and orientation of ribbon cables and other connectors. It can be very easy to remove them quickly during disassembly and then to face a puzzle during reassembly.\n\nNote: A useful tip is to take a photo of the underside of the laptop and print it out. As you remove screws, tape them to the relevant point in your picture. This ensures you will not lose any and will know which screw goes where. Photograph each stage of disassembly so you know where to re-fit cables and connectors.\n\nAs with a desktop, organize parts that you remove or have ready for installation carefully. Keep the parts away from your main work area so that you do not damage them by mistake. Keep static-sensitive parts, such as the CPU, memory, and adapter cards, in anti-static packaging.\n\nFORM FACTORS AND PLASTICS/FRAMES\nMany laptops are built using proprietary components and scope for customization and upgrade is fairly limited. However, as laptops have become cheaper and more popular, there are more vendors offering "bare bones" laptops and compatible components.\n\nThe laptop chassis incorporates the motherboard, power supply, display screen, keypad, and touchpad. The plastics or aluminum frames are the hard surfaces that cover the internal components of the laptop. They are secured using either small screws or pressure tabs. Note that screws may be covered by rubber or plastic tabs.\n\nMake sure you obtain the manufacturer's service documentation before commencing any upgrade or replacement work. This should explain how to disassemble the chassis and remove tricky items, such as plastic bezels, without damaging them. You should only perform this work if a warranty option is not available.\nTag: C1 L8 TB

LAPTOP FRUs\n\nLaptops have fewer field replaceable units (FRUs) than desktops. That said, laptop components and designs have become better standardized. Using components sourced from the laptop vendor is still recommended, but basic upgrade options, such as memory and disks, have become much simpler as it reduces warranty support costs for the vendors.\n\nSome FRUs can be accessed easily by removing a screw plate on the back cover (underside) of the laptop. This method generally provides access to the disk drive, optical drive, memory modules, and possibly Mini PCIe adapters such as Wi-Fi cards and modems. The connectors can usually be flipped up and down to allow easy insertion and removal.\nTag: C1 L8 TB

MASS STORAGE FOR LAPTOPS\n\nLaptops use the same kind of mass storage devices as PCs:\n• Hard Disk Drive (HDD)—magnetic disk technology offering low cost per gigabyte storage.\n• Solid State Drive (SSD)—flash memory technology offering much faster performance and less weight and power consumption. SSDs are now the mainstream choice for laptops.\n• Hybrid—an HDD with a large (8 GB+) cache of flash memory, offering a performance boost compared to basic HDDs.\n\nA laptop typically supports one internal mass storage device only, with extra storage attached to an external port. The internal drive can usually be accessed via a panel, but you may have to open the chassis on some models.\n\nLaptop mass storage drives are usually 2.5" form factor though sometimes the 1.8" form factor is used. Compared to 3.5" desktop versions, magnetic 2.5" HDDs tend to be slower (usually 5400 rpm models) and lower capacity. Within the 2.5" form factor, there are also reduced height units designed for ultraportable laptops. A standard 2.5" drive has a z-height of 9.5 mm; an ultraportable laptop might require a 7 mm (thin) or 5 mm (ultrathin) drive.\n\n(https://4sorcero.s3.amazonaws.com/byteback/core_1/fig_core_1_427.png)\nA laptop HDD with SATA interface. (Image © 123RF.com.)\n\nMagnetic and hybrid drives use ordinary SATA data and power connectors, though the connectors on the drive mate directly to a port in the drive bay, without the use of a cable. 1.8" drive bays might require the use of the Micro SATA (μSATA or uSATA) connector.\n\nSSD flash storage devices can also use the SATA interface and connector form factors but could also use an adapter or memory card-like interface:\n• mSATA—an SSD might be housed on a card with a Mini-SATA (mSATA) interface. These cards resemble Mini PCIe cards but are not physically compatible with Mini PCIe slots. mSATA uses the SATA bus, so the maximum transfer speed is 6 Gbps.\n• M.2—this is a new set of form factors for mini card interfaces. An M.2 SSD usually interfaces with the PCI Express bus, allowing much higher bus speeds than SATA. M. 2 adapters can be different lengths (42 mm, 60 mm, 80 mm, or 110 mm) so you should check that any given adapter will fit within the laptop chassis. 80 mm (M.2 2280) is the most popular length for laptop SSDs.\n\nNote: The specific M.2 form factor is written as 22 nn, where nn is the length. "22" refers to the card width, all of which are 22 mm.\nTag: C1 L8 TB

LAPTOP RAM\n\nLaptop DDR SDRAM is packaged in small modules called (SODIMM) Small Outline DIMM. Both DDR and DDR2 use 200-pin packages, but the key position for DDR2 is slightly different to prevent insertion in a slot designed for DDR. DDR3 uses a 204-pin SODIMM module whereas DDR4 modules have 260 pins.\n\n(https://4sorcero.s3.amazonaws.com/byteback/core_1/fig_core_1_428.png)\nLaptop RAM\n\nThe memory is typically fitted into slots that pop-up at a 45º angle to allow the chips to be inserted or removed. Sometimes one of the memory slots is easily accessible via a panel but another requires more extensive disassembly of the chassis to access.\n\nNote: There are a couple of other laptop memory module form factors, including Mini-DIMM and Micro-DIMM. These are smaller than SODIMM and used on some ultraportable models. Always check the vendor documentation before obtaining parts for upgrade or replacement.\nTag: C1 L8 TB

ADAPTER CARDS FOR LAPTOPS\n\nDepending on the design, adapters for modems, wireless cards, and SSD storage cards may be accessible and replaceable via screw-down panels. Note that there are a number of adapter formats, notably Mini PCIe, mSATA, and M.2, none of which are compatible with one another.\n\nYou can obtain "wireless" mini PCIe or M.2 adapters for laptops that will provide some combination of Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, and/or cellular data (4G LTE) connectivity. Remember that when upgrading this type of adapter, you need to re-connect the antenna wires used by the old adapter or install a new antenna kit. The antenna wires are usually routed around the screen in the laptop's lid. The antenna connections can be tricky and are quite delicate, so take care.\n\nIf installing an adapter with cellular functionality, remember to insert the SIM as well.\nTag: C1 L8 TB

OPTICAL DRIVES FOR LAPTOPS\n\nLaptops use slimline optical drive units. The unit is typically accessible from the bottom panel. As with a hard drive, the unit mates with a fixed SATA data and power connector at the back of the drive bay. You will typically need to replace the device with the same Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM) part, or at least the same caddy design.\n\nNote: Optical drives are of decreasing relevance to mobile computing. It is more cost-effective to use an external drive as a replacement. You might want to consider replacing an optical drive with a second hard drive. The hard drive must be fitted to a caddy that fits the optical drive bay.\nTag: C1 L8 TB

LAPTOP CPU AND MOTHERBOARD UPGRADES\n\nThe CPU is generally upgradeable as long as the new device is supported by the\nmotherboard.\n\nNote: Some laptop CPUs—those that use Ball Grid Array (BGA) sockets—are soldered to the motherboard and, therefore, are not upgradeable.\n\nThe CPU is covered by a heatpipe, rather than a heat sink. This is a long, flat metal strip that conducts heat toward the fan. Otherwise, it is locked into place in much the same way as a desktop CPU.\n\nThere will be few occasions when it is economical to replace the system board itself. If you do need to do so, detach the stand-offs that hold the board to the chassis. If upgrading the system board, you will probably also need to update the chipset driver (or notebook system software) and allow Windows to discover the new device using Plug-and-Play.\nTag: C1 L8 TB

LAPTOP VIDEO CARD UPGRADES\n\nLaptops often use an integrated graphics adapter that is part of the system chipset or CPU, especially at the lower end of the market. Integrated graphics can be advantageous in terms of battery life and cooling. However, as laptops get used more and more as desktop replacements, particularly as game machines, dedicated graphics becomes important. Cheaper graphics adapters may also feature a limited amount of onboard memory (or none at all). In this scenario, they share syste\nmmemory with the CPU. Obviously, this decreases the amount of system memory available.\n\nFew laptop video cards are actually upgradeable, though they may be replaceable. This is because high-end cards tend to have specific power and cooling requirements and a modular approach is not possible given the limited space available.\nTag: C1 L8 TB

LAPTOP COMPONENT REPLACEMENT\n\nThere are other components that you may need to replace to effect repairs. In most cases, you will need to source "like-for-like" replacements to ensure the proper fit.\n\nLAPTOP DISPLAY AND DIGITIZER REPLACEMENT\nA built-in laptop display will be one of three types:\n• LCD (TFT) with fluorescent backlight—this has been the standard display technology for the last few years. The backlight is a fluorescent bulb that illuminates the image, making it bright and clear. An inverter supplies the correct AC voltage to the backlight from the laptop's DC power circuits.\n• LCD with LED backlight—manufacturers are increasingly switching to this technology. LED backlights do not require an inverter.\n• OLED—this technology is expensive at the screen size required by laptops and there are issues with power draw and battery life. Consequently, OLED has not really established itself as a mainstream choice for laptop displays.\n\nWhen a laptop has a touchscreen display, it will also have a digitizer fitted. The digitizer is sandwiched between a layer of glass and the LCD display. Analog signals are created when you tap or swipe the surface of the display. The digitizer is connected to the laptop with a flexible digitizer cable. A grid of sensors is activated when you tap or swipe the screen. The information from the sensors is sent through the digitizer cable to a circuit that converts the analog signal to a digital signal.\n\nIf you need to replace a display, digitizer, or inverter, make a very careful record of how the existing unit is connected to the video card and system board, including the routing of any cables.\n\nNote: Replacing these components is relatively tricky and upgrading them can be even more complex. Make sure you get specific information or advice for the model of laptop you are servicing.\nTag: C1 L8 TB

LAPTOP SPEAKER REPLACEMENT\n\nTo replace laptop speakers, you will need to disassemble the laptop to the system board. Make sure you obtain replacement speakers that are compatible with your laptop model. Remove the old speakers and fit the new ones, remembering to connect the audio cable.\nTag: C1 L8 TB

LAPTOP INPUT DEVICE REPLACEMENT\n\nLaptop input devices include keyboards, touchpads, webcams, microphones, and smart card readers.\n\nKEYBOARDS AND TOUCHPADS\nWhen you are replacing components like the keyboard and touchpad, you will almost always need to use the same parts. Each part connects to the motherboard via a data cable, typically a flat ribbon type. Accessing the parts for removal and replacement might require complete disassembly or might be relatively straightforward—check the service documentation.\n\nNote: If you are upgrading the keyboard or touchpad (rather than replacing the same part), you may need to install a new driver and configure settings via the Mouse and Keyboard applets.\n\nWEBCAMS AND MICROPHONES\nAlmost all laptops come with built-in webcams and microphones. The webcam is normally positioned at the top of the display with an LED to show whether it is active.\n\nNote: Laptop users are understandably worried about the privacy implications of built-in webcams. If the laptop is infected with malware, it is usually possible for the malware to enable the webcam without activating the LED.\n\nThe microphone will be positioned somewhere on the laptop chassis. There will also be microphone and speaker 3.5 mm jacks for the connection of a headset or external speakers.\n\nSMART CARD READERS\nA smart card reader is a feature of enterprise laptops supporting authentication using digital smart cards. You will typically need to replace this with the same OEM part. The laptop will probably need to be completely disassembled to access the device. It is connected to the system board by a data cable.\nTag: C1 L8 TB

LAPTOP POWER SUPPLIES\n\nPortable computers can work off both building power and battery operation.\n\nAC ADAPTERS\nTo operate from building power, the laptop needs a power supply that can convert from the AC (Alternating Current) supplied by the power company to the DC (Direct Current) voltages used by the laptop's components. The power supply is provided as an external AC adapter.\n\nAC adapters are normally universal (or auto-switching) and can operate from any 110-240 VAC 50/60 Hz supply (check the label to confirm). Some adapters (notably some sold with US machines) are fixed-input (for instance, they only work with a 115 VAC supply or have to be manually switched to the correct input).\n\n(https://4sorcero.s3.amazonaws.com/byteback/core_1/fig_core_1_432.png)\nAn AC adapter for an HP laptop. (Image by Olga Popova © 123RF.com.)\n\nNote: Plugging a fixed-input 240 V adapter into a 110 V supply won't cause any damage (though the laptop won't work), but plugging a fixed-input 110 V adapter into a 240 V supply will.\n\nNote: When you are using a laptop abroad, in addition to a universal AC adapter, you will also need a power plug adapter to fit the type of socket used in that country. It is also best to get a surge protector designed for the voltage used in the country too. This helps to protect the laptop from damage.\n\nAC adapters are also rated for their power output (ranging from around 65-120 W). Again, this information will be printed on the adapter label. Output (W) is calculated by multiplying voltage (V) by current (I). A larger output will be able to power more peripheral devices.\n\nThe power output of adapters and batteries can vary, so using an adapter designed for an ultra-mobile model probably won't work with a desktop replacement, even if it's the same brand. A 90 W adapter should be sufficient for most uses, but always check the documentation carefully. If you need to replace the power supply, it is best to get the manufacturer's recommended model, though universal AC adapters are available. These typically ship with a number of DC power connectors, which vary quite widely in size. They also have variable voltage settings. You must set the voltage correctly before plugging it in.\n\nNote: Most laptops will display a message at boot time if an underpowered AC adapter or battery is present.\n\nDC JACK REPLACEMENT\nIt is relatively common for the DC jack to fail. The port can become loose over time or the jack itself can become separated from the motherboard. Replacing a DC jack means disassembling the laptop, de-soldering and removing the old jack, then soldering the new jack into place. Most laptop DC jacks are specific to the manufacturer and even the laptop model.\n\n(https://4sorcero.s3.amazonaws.com/byteback/core_1/fig_core_1_433a.png)\nReplacement DC jack—the part is soldered to the motherboard via the contact pin seen on the right. (Image by Sergey Kolesnikov © 123RF.com.)\n\nBATTERY POWER\nLaptop computers use removable, rechargeable Lithium ion (Li-ion) battery packs. Li-ion batteries have good storage capacity and hold their charge well. They are typically available in 6, 9, or 12 cell versions, with more cells providing for a longer charge.\n\nBefore inserting or removing the battery pack, you must always turn the machine off and unplug it from the AC wall outlet. A portable battery is usually removed by releasing catches on the back or underside of the laptop.\n\n(https://4sorcero.s3.amazonaws.com/byteback/core_1/fig_core_1_433b.png)\nA removable laptop battery pack. (Image by cristi180884 © 123RF.com.)\n\nA portable computer's battery can be charged in three ways:\n• Plug the computer into an AC wall outlet with the computer turned off. This method is called a quick charge. It takes a couple of hours to fully charge a flat battery.\n• Charge the battery while the computer is plugged into an AC wall outlet and turned on. This method is called a trickle charge. Trickle charging is slower because the primary use of power is for operating the PC, rather than for charging the battery. It can take several hours to charge a battery while the machine is turned on.\n• Use a battery charger. This method charges the battery while it is not in the computer, but involves purchasing an extra charging unit.\n\nTo maximize battery life, different battery types require different charging regimes. Always consult the manufacturer's instructions for obtaining optimal battery life for a specific product. Modern Li-ion batteries should not be allowed to fully discharge, as this reduces battery life. They benefit from regular charging and have circuitry to prevent over-charging. However, some degree of caution should be exercised when leaving batteries to recharge unattended (for example, overnight) as this circuitry has been known to fail. Do not leave a battery charger close to flammable material and ensure there is plenty of ventilation around the unit.\n\nLi-ion batteries are also sensitive to heat. If storing a Li-ion battery, reduce the charge to 40% and store at below 20º C.\n\nNote: Li-ion batteries hold less charge as they age and typically have a maximum usable life of around 2-3 years. If you charge a battery and the run time is substantially decreased, you may need to purchase a new battery.\nTag: C1 L8 TB

Activity 8-2\nDiscussing Laptop Hardware\nInstallation and Configuration\n\nSCENARIO\nAnswer the following questions to check your understanding of the topic.\n\nQuestion 1. What is the process for installing memory in a laptop?\n\nAnswer 1. Verify that the DDR version of the upgrade module is supported by the motherboard. Take anti-static precautions. Locate the memory slot, which is usually accessed via a panel on the back cover. Move the connector up to 45º and insert the memory card, taking care to align it correctly. Push the card flat again.\n\nQuestion 2. What type of standard adapter card might be used to connect internal FRU devices to the motherboard of a laptop?\n\nAnswer 2. Mini-PCIe, mSATA, or M.2.\n\nQuestion 3. What distinguishes a magnetic hard drive designed for a laptop from one designed for a PC?\n\nAnswer 3. Laptop drives are 2.5" (or sometimes 1.8"), rather than 3.5". They also tend to be slower (5,400 rpm, rather than 7,200 or 10,000 rpm) and lower capacity. The largest at the time of writing is 5 TB, so this may not be a limiting factor in practice.\n\nQuestion 4. A user reports that when they plug in anything to a USB port on the laptop, the device is not recognized by the system. Is this something you can easily repair?\n\nAnswer 4. Typically, the processor, the DC jack, and USB ports are attached directly on the board and cannot be replaced without replacing the whole laptop motherboard. If the other USB ports are functional, a USB hub could provide additional ports.\n\nQuestion 5. Several laptops need to be replaced in the next fiscal cycle, but that doesn't begin for several months. You want to improve functionality as much as possible by upgrading or replacing components in some of the laptops that are having problems. Which items are most easily replaced in a laptop?\n\nAnswer 5. The fixed drive, system memory (RAM), and plug-in wireless card will be the easiest upgradable components to install. If items need repairing, fans, the screen, the battery, touchpad, and the keyboard should be straightforward to replace, if you can obtain compatible parts.\nTag: C1 L8 TB A8-2

Activity 8-3\nInstalling and Configuring Laptop Hardware\n\nBEFORE YOU BEGIN\nRead the following notes carefully before you start:\n\n• Create a clean work environment with plenty of working space.\n• Gather all necessary tools and equipment. A notepad and pen will be useful for making diagrams and notes.\n• Implement anti-static and safety procedures.\n• Make sure that the laptop is powered off and disconnected from building and battery power before proceeding.\n• Always take time and care.\n• Always place static-sensitive equipment such as processors and memory in anti-static bags.\n\nSCENARIO\nIn the first part of the activity, you will disassemble a laptop using these steps as your guidelines. Check with your instructor for any extra instructions. Your instructor may precautions and anti-not want you to completely disassemble the laptop due to the risk of breaking plastics, etc. If so, make a note now of which step you are to stop at.\n\nIn the second part of the activity, you will reassemble a laptop, working from the notes made by your partner.\n\nQuestion 1. Shut down Windows and turn off your laptop.\n\nQuestion 2. Disconnect all peripherals (keyboard, mouse, and monitor), removable storage (media bay or memory card), and power cables from the system unit. Place these in a tidy manner under your workbench (or wherever your instructor tells you to).\n\nQuestion 3. Remove the laptop battery and store it safely. Hold down the laptop power button for 30 seconds.\n\nQuestion 4. With the lid shut, flip the laptop and use your notepad and pen to make a diagram of the existing layout of cut-out panels and drives, plus their screw locations.  Some screws may be covered by caps or rubber feet.\n\nQuestion 5. Remove each cut-out and its component, making a careful note of how to reconnect any wires and cables attached to adapter cards. Carefully put each component in an anti-static bag and the screws in a container, using a system to identify which screw is used at any given location.\n\nQuestion 6. If you are continuing from here, release the screws that secure the chassis and any other issues. the plastics (palm rest and touchpad assembly). Carefully put the screws in a container, using a system to identify which screw is used at any given location.\n\nQuestion 7. Flip the laptop over again, and open the lid. Remove the plastic bezel at the top of the keyboard. This might be difficult but take care not to snap it. When lifting the bezel, take care to discover whether any cables are connected to it. If there are, unplug them and make a note of how they should be re-attached.\n\nQuestion 8. Remove the keyboard by releasing the screws that secure it, then unplugging the ribbon cable. Record how the cable should be reattached, then store the components.\n\nQuestion 9. Disconnect the LCD cable and LCD power connector connecting the display to the motherboard. There is also likely to be a cable connecting the radio antenna (running around the screen) to the wireless adapter. Again, make a careful note of how to reconnect these components.\n\nQuestion 10. Remove the LCD panel, taking care to handle and store it safely, as it is fragile.\n\nQuestion 11. Locate any remaining cables preventing disassembly of the top panel (touchpad, audio connectors, and power button, for instance) taking care to note how they should be reconnected.\n\nQuestion 12. Remove any internal drive cages or heat pipes covering the components you want to inspect. As with a desktop, make a careful note of how fan power connectors are attached.\n\nNote: This concludes the first part of the activity.\n\nQuestion 13. When you and your partner have completed the first part of the activity, swap places and completely reassemble your partner's laptop. Allow them to access any notes and diagrams you have made, and tell them of any particular difficulties you had during disassembly.\n\nQuestion 14. Reboot the laptop that you just reassembled. If it does not reboot, or if there are errors when you try to resolve the problem, ask your instructor for guidance.\nTag: C1 L8 TB A8-3

Topic C\nTroubleshoot Common Laptop Issues\n\nEXAM OBJECTIVES COVERED\n1001-5.5 Given a scenario, troubleshoot common mobile device issues while adhering to the appropriate procedures.\n\nPart of your duties as a CompTIA A+ technician will be helping users when they encounter problems with their mobile devices. In this topic, you will troubleshoot issues with laptop hardware and associated mobile app issues.\nTag: C1 L8 TC

COMMON LAPTOP ISSUES\n\nThe same basic approach to troubleshooting applies for laptops as it does for desktop PCs, though there are some issues specific to laptops and other portable devices that you should be aware of.\n• Display issues, including problems with built-in display devices, touchscreens, and external displays.\n• Power and cooling issues.\n• Input and output device issues.\n• Communication and connectivity issues.\n• Issues with GPS and location services.\n• OS and app issues, such as performance problems and unresponsive apps.\nTag: C1 L8 TC

DISPLAY ISSUES\n\nDisplay issues include:\n• Problems with a built-in display. When you are troubleshooting a laptop display, you will often need to take into account the use of the integrated display and/or an external display and how to isolate a problem to a particular component, such as either display, the video card, or a display toggle.\n\nThe components most likely to fail on an older LCD screen are the backlight and inverter. The backlight is a fluorescent bulb that illuminates the image, making it bright and clear. The inverter supplies the correct AC voltage to the backlight. If the display has been flickering or if the image is very dim, but still present, suspect a problem with the backlight or inverter rather than the LCD itself. As you may know if you have fluorescent lighting at home, the inverter is more likely to fail than the tube itself.\n\nMany laptops now use LED arrays for the backlight. As these work off DC power, there is no inverter.\n\nThe LCD is only likely to need replacing if it gets physically damaged.\n\nNote: As well as the display itself, it is fairly common for the plastics around the case to get cracked or broken and for the hinges on the lid to wear out. The plastics are mostly cosmetic (though a bad break might expose the laptop's internal components to greater risks) but if the hinges no longer hold up the screen, they will have to be replaced.\n\nThe backlight, inverter, or screen on a laptop can be replaced by unscrewing the plastic bezel (the screws will be concealed by rubber stoppers). Take care not to damage the connectors once the panel has been freed from its housing.\n\nProblems with a touchscreen.\n•  Common touchscreen issues include:\n• Touchscreen is not responsive.\n• Touchscreen doesn't act as expected.\n\nProblems with an external display.\n•  External display issues include:\n• No image on external display.\n• Wrong image on external display.\n• External display image is too large or too small.\nTag: C1 L8 TC

GUIDELINES FOR TROUBLESHOOTING DISPLAY ISSUES\n\nNote:  All of the Guidelines for this lesson are available as checklists from the Checklist tile on the CHOICE Course screen.\n\nHere are some guidelines for troubleshooting display issues.\n\n\nTROUBLESHOOT BUILT-IN DISPLAY ISSUES\nConsider these guidelines when you need to troubleshoot built-in display issues:\n• Determine whether the source of the problem is the integrated display, an external display, or other component of the display subsystem.\n    o First check that the video card is good by using an external monitor. Toggle the appropriate Fn key—usually Fn+4 or Fn+8. Alternatively, there should be a very dim image on the LCD if the graphics adapter is functioning but the backlight/inverter has failed.\n    o Ensure the laptop is switched to using the built-in display again. Check that power management settings are not set to an energy saving mode that disables or dims the backlight.\n    o Check that a cutoff switch (a small plastic pin near the hinge connecting the LCD to the rest of the chassis) is not stuck. When it is depressed, power to the backlight is switched off.\n    o If all these tests are negative, the backlight, inverter, or cable has failed. If the backlight flickers (or has been flickering before complete failure), there's more likely to be a problem with the inverter. An inverter can be tested using a bulb or multimeter, but at this point you will probably need to book the laptop in for repair or use it with an external monitor only.\n• Check for physical damage. If the display is damaged (if it has been bent or dented, for example), this can cause pixelation problems—areas of the image break down with mis-coloring, blockiness, or jaggedness.\n• Check the resolution. LCDs are best used at the native resolution. Any other resolution will produce some distortion in the image, which isn't a sign of a fault in the screen itself. Also, fast changing images (such as those produced by video playback) can produce artifacts on low quality screens.\n• Check the driver. When updating the driver for a display adapter, check whether the laptop vendor has released their own driver. Laptops often contain OEM (Original Equipment Manufacturer) versions of graphics adapters and you need to use the system vendor's driver rather than the retail driver.\n\nTROUBLESHOOT TOUCHSCREEN ISSUES\nConsider these guidelines when you need to troubleshoot touchscreen issues such as unresponsive or misbehaving touchscreens:\n• Verify that the touchscreen is clean.\n• Look for evidence that the laptop might have been dropped or severely damaged.\n• Try using the device in a different location in case some source of electromagnetic interference (EMI) is affecting the operation of the touchscreen.\n• If the laptop has just been serviced, check that the right wires are still connected in the right places for the digitizer to function. Remember to ask "What has changed?"\n• If you cannot identify an obvious physical problem, you should attempt to rule out a software problem before suspecting a more serious hardware problem.\n    o In many cases, a restart may solve the problem.\n    o In Windows, you can also try uninstalling the touchscreen driver and reinstalling the device, using the latest driver if possible.\n    o You could also try running the calibration utility.\n\nNote: Removing a faulty digitizer from an existing display can be tricky. It might be cheaper to replace the whole unit, depending on the cost of parts.\n\nTROUBLESHOOT EXTERNAL DISPLAY ISSUES\nConsider these guidelines as you troubleshoot external display issues such as no image or wrong image on an external display, or if the external display image is too large or too small:\n• A keyboard toggle switch cuts the display between built-in only, both simultaneously, and external only. Verify this switch is set properly.\n• Windows display settings control whether the external display duplicates or extends the built-in one. If there is no external image and the toggle button is set correctly, after checking other obvious things (Is the external display switched on? Is it in power-saving mode? Is it set to the correct input mode? Is the cable connected?), check that the resolution for the external display is appropriate. • Look for updated drivers for the graphics adapter and laptop chipset (system software).\n• Try a different display unit and/or cable to rule out hardware problems.\n\nNote: If the external display is connected via a cable, try using a different (known good) cable. If the display is using a wireless connection, such as Miracast or Wi-Fi Direct, check that both device and display support the same standards.\nTag: C1 L8 TC

POWER AND COOLING ISSUES\n\nPower and cooling issues include battery issues, AC power issues, and overheating.\n• Battery issues. If you are working from the battery, first check that it is inserted correctly and seated properly in its compartment. Also check whether the battery contacts are dirty. You can clean them by using alcohol preps or even just a dry cloth.\n\nAn LED may be present to indicate when the laptop is running on battery power or an LED may simply show when a battery is being charged. If the battery is properly inserted and still does not work, it is most likely completely discharged. If the battery will not hold a charge, it could be at the end of its useful life. You can test this by using a "known good" battery; if this does not work, then there is something wrong with the power circuitry on the motherboard. Properly caring for the battery not only prolongs battery life, but also mitigates health and safety risks. Using an incorrect battery charging cable or exposing a battery to harsh environmental conditions, such as extreme heat, can result in an explosion.\n\n• Short battery life. As batteries age, the maximum charge they can sustain decreases, so short battery life will usually indicate that the battery needs replacing. If the battery is not old or faulty, you could suspect that an app is putting excessive  strain on the battery. In Windows 10, you can use the Settings app to identify whether an app is having an adverse effect on battery life.\n\n(https://4sorcero.s3.amazonaws.com/byteback/core_1/fig_core_1_442.png)\nBattery status and notifications in Windows 10. (Screenshot used with permission from Microsoft.)\n\n• Swollen batteries. If you notice any swelling from the battery compartment, discontinue use of the laptop immediately. Signs that the battery has swollen can include a device that wobbles when placed flat on a desk or a deformed touchpad or keyboard. A swollen battery is usually caused by overcharging, indicating some sort of problem with the battery's charging circuit, which is supposed to prevent overcharging. If a device is exposed to liquid, this could also have damaged the battery.\n\nLi-ion batteries are designed to swell to avoid bursting or exploding but great care must be taken when handling a swollen battery to avoid further damage that may cause it to burst or explode. It may also be a fire hazard and/or leaking hazardous chemicals—do not allow these to come into contact with your skin or your eyes. If the battery cannot be released safely and easily from its compartment, contact the manufacturer for advice. You should also contact the manufacturer for specific disposal instructions. A swollen battery should not be discarded via standard recycling points unless the facility confirms it can accept batteries in a potentially hazardous state.\n\nNote: Problems with batteries and AC adapters often occur in batches. Make sure you remain signed up to the vendor's alerting service so that you are informed about any product recalls or safety advisories.\n\n• AC power issues. AC power issues usually surface as problems with a battery not charging, slow performance, devices not functioning. error messages, and spontaneous rebooting.\n\n• Overheating. Overheating can be a considerable problem with laptops due to their compact size and integrated design. The components are all within close proximity and can generate and trap a lot of heat.\n\nDust trapped in cooling passages acts as an insulator and can prevent proper cooling, possibly resulting in overheating. Excessive heat should be avoided in such devices as it can shorten the life of components.\n\nThe bottom surface of the laptop gets quite hot when improperly ventilated. This can easily happen when laptops are put on soft surfaces, on people's laps, or in places where there is not enough room between the vents and a wall. Sometimes people will get careless and unwittingly cover the vents with books, mouse pads, etc.\n\nThere are several cooling methods and considerations used to keep the devices within a safe heat range for operation:\no Laptop CPUs are engineered to draw less power and thus run cooler than their similarly rated desktop counterparts.\no Fans are used to move the hot air out from the inside of the laptop case.\no Limit the use of the laptop battery as much as possible. The battery itself can be a heat source.\no Laptop cooling (or chiller) pads are accessories that are designed to sit under the laptop to protect a user from getting a burn from a device overheating. The cooler is placed underneath the laptop to move the air away from the device.\nTag: C1 L8 TC

GUIDELINES FOR TROUBLESHOOTING POWER AND COOLING ISSUES\n\nHere are some guidelines for troubleshooting power and cooling issues.\n\nTROUBLESHOOT BATTERY ISSUES\nSome simple guidelines for acceptable battery maintenance include:\n• Follow manufacturer instructions on the proper charging and discharging of the battery.\n• Use the battery charger provided by the manufacturer or an approved replacement charger.\n• Never expose the battery to fire or water or drop, throw, or jolt the battery.\n• Only use the recommended battery for your device.\n• Make use of power management features included with your device/OS to prolong battery life.\n\nTROUBLESHOOT AC POWER ISSUES\nConsider these guidelines as you troubleshoot AC power issues:\n• If there is a power problem, first establish how the laptop should be operated and confirm that this procedure is being followed. For example, some laptops require that a battery be present, even on AC power.\n• If you experience problems working from AC power, first test the outlet with a known good" device (such as a lamp). Next check that an LED on the AC adapter is green; if there is no LED, check the fuse on the plug and if available, try testing with a "known good" adapter.\n• If this does not work, inspect the DC socket on the laptop for any sign of damage.\nYou could also check the AC adapter using a multimeter.\n\nNote: Most adapters contain a circuit breaker to prevent overloads. If this trips, it will be a few minutes before the adapter will work again.\n\n• Sometimes AC adapters can get mixed up. If an underpowered adapter is used—for example, a 65 W adapter is plugged into a 90 W system—the laptop BIOS will display a warning at boot time.\n• As with desktops, spontaneous reboots may indicate a power problem, though a more likely cause is overheating. Another possibility is that peripherals are trying to draw down too much power.\n• Try disconnecting drives from the media bays or USB then re-booting to see if the problem is fixed. Note that larger 3.5" hard drives and external CD/DVD writers will typically require their own power supply, even if connected via USB.\n\nTROUBLESHOOT COOLING ISSUES\nConsider these guidelines as you troubleshoot cooling issues:\n• Because laptops do not have the air circulation that desktop PCs do, it is important to keep the device air ducts clean.\n• In servicing laptops, it is a good practice to regularly blow dust from the cooling passages using compressed air or vacuum it with an electronics vacuum. When using compressed air to clean the inside of the laptop, you must be cautious of the internal components. It is easy to damage other components inside the laptop while cleaning.\nTag: C1 L8 TC

INPUT AND OUTPUT DEVICE ISSUES\n\nHere are some common issues you might encounter with laptop input and output devices:\n• Input devices. The main problem with keypads tends to be stuck keys.\n\nBe aware that the Function (Fn) keys can often be used to disable devices, such as the wireless adapter. Each device will have an LED on the chassis showing whether it is enabled or not.\n\nIf the laptop does not have a separate keypad, users may become confused when NumLock is active and the keys go to numeric input.\n\nAnother issue is with using an external keyboard and experiencing problems with the Function key being locked. This can typically be solved by turning off NumLock on the external keyboard.\n\nAnother problem is where the touchpad is configured to be too sensitive and typing causes vibrations that move the cursor. Examples include the pointer drifting across the screen without any input or a "ghost cursor" jumping about when typing.\n\n• Sound and speaker issues. On a laptop, problems can arise with the onboard speakers and with external speakers, resulting in no sound or distorted sound.\n\nGUIDELINES FOR TROUBLESHOOTING INPUT AND OUTPUT DEVICE ISSUES\nHere are some guidelines for troubleshooting input and output device issues.\n\nTROUBLESHOOT INPUT AND OUTPUT DEVICE ISSUES\nConsider these guidelines as you troubleshoot input and output device issues:\n• If there is debris under a key, try cleaning with compressed air.\n• If the laptop has been serviced recently and the keyboard has stopped working, check that the connector has not been dislodged as some service operations require the keyboard to be removed.\n\nNote: Removing a key on a laptop keyboard can be a risky proposition. They are typically not the type of key where the key cap is in a peg, which you find on full-sized keyboards. Laptop keys are usually floating on a dual-hinge mechanism, usually plastic, that will easily break if you attempt to remove it forcefully. Refer to the manufacturer's instructions when attempting to fix a key on the keyboard.\n\n• If a device that is activated via a function key is not working, check that it has not been disabled by accident.\n\n• If the wrong characters appear when you type, check the NumLock status indicator if available.\n\n• For touchpad issues, install up-to-date drivers and configure input options to suit the user. Many laptops now come with a Fn key to disable the touchpad.\n\nNote: Conversely, mouse problems can often arise following the installation of updates or version upgrades. Try to identify "what changed?" when troubleshooting problems like this.\n\n• If no sound is played from the onboard speakers:\n• Check that the volume controls have not been turned all the way down or that sound has not been muted. Remember that on a laptop there may be function or multimedia keys to control the volume.\n\n• Check that the correct playback device is configured in Windows (using the Sound applet in Control Panel). The applet includes a utility that can test the speaker setup.\n\n• If you cannot locate a configuration problem, try connecting external speakers or a headset to identify whether the problem may be with the internal speaker unit.\n• If there is no sound from either type of output, suspect a problem with the sound card or internal wiring.\nTag: C1 L8 TC

COMMUNICATION AND CONNECTIVITY ISSUES\n\nWi-Fi and Bluetooth connectivity issues on a laptop can be approached in much the same way as on a PC. Problems can generally be categorized as either relating to physical" issues, such as interference, or to "software" configuration problems.\n• Remember that wireless devices need power.\n• Wireless devices can often experience difficulties following the laptop being put into sleep or hibernation mode.\n• If there are intermittent connectivity problems, be aware that wireless input and communications devices can experience trouble with interference.\n\nNote: The radio antenna wire for a mobile will be built into the case (normally around the screen).\n\nGPS AND LOCATION SERVICES\nHere are some issues you might encounter with GPS and location services:\n• GPS and other wireless functions do not seem to work at all, or they work only intermittently.\n• GPS does not usually work well indoors as the satellite signals lack the power to penetrate dense construction material. Most devices use a combination of GPS and the Indoor Positioning System (IPS), which uses information from nearby Wi-Fi hotspots, to provide location services.\nTag: C1 L8 TC

GUIDELINES FOR TROUBLESHOOTING COMMUNICATION AND CONNECTIVITY ISSUES\n\nHere are some guidelines for troubleshooting communication and connectivity issues.\n\nTROUBLESHOOT COMMUNICATION AND CONNECTIVITY ISSUES\nConsider these guidelines when you are troubleshooting issues with communication\n• If there is a problem with wireless, Bluetooth, or cellular data/GPS:\n• Verify that the adapter is enabled.\n• Check the status of function key toggles on a laptop or use the notification shade toggles on a mobile device to check that something like airplane mode has not been enabled.\n• Different wireless functions may be toggled on or off selectively or collectively.\n• If the laptop has been serviced recently and wireless functions have stopped working, check that the antenna connector has not been dislodged or wrongly connected.\n• If a wireless device such as a Bluetooth mouse or keyboard that has been working stops, it probably needs a new battery.\n• If you experience problems restoring from hibernate or sleep mode, try cycling the power on the device or reconnecting it and check for updated drivers for the wireless controller and the devices.\n• If you are experiencing intermittent connectivity issues:\n• Try moving the two devices closer together.\n• Try moving the devices from side-to-side or up-and-down.\n• Consider using a Wi-Fi analyzer to measure the signal strength in different locations to try to identify the source of interference.\n• If there is a problem with the Global Positioning System (GPS):\n• Check that the GPS receiver is enabled and that the laptop is not in airplane mode.\n• Ensure that Location Services are enabled for the device.\n• Verify that each app has been granted permission to use the service. If the app does not prompt for permission if it has not been granted, try uninstalling and reinstalling the app.\nTag: C1 L8 TC

OS AND APP ISSUES\n\nAlthough this topic covers common laptop hardware issues, you should also be aware of some problems that can arise from OS and app issues.\n• Slow performance.\n• Unresponsive devices and apps.\n• Email issues. Users often want to send confidential email with the assurance that only the recipient can read it. To do this, the recipient sends the sender a digital certificate and the sender uses the public key in that certificate to encrypt the message. The recipient then uses another part of the certificate (the private key) to decrypt the message. If the certificate is missing or not recognized, the device will be unable to decrypt the email.\nTag: C1 L8 TC

GUIDELINES FOR TROUBLESHOOTING OS AND APP ISSUES\n\nHere are some guidelines for troubleshooting OS and app issues.\n\nTROUBLESHOOT OS AND APP ISSUES\nConsider these guidelines as you troubleshoot OS and app issues on a laptop:\n• For slow performance issues:\n• A Windows laptop might suffer from slow performance for the same reasons as a PC and you should approach troubleshooting in the same way.\n\nSlow performance on a mobile device is likely either to be caused by an app that requires a higher system specification or by running too many apps. Mobile devices are designed to manage system requirements without intervention from the user, but it may be worth closing all apps in case there is a fault in one that has not been detected.\n• For unresponsive apps and devices: If an app or the mobile device as a whole is not responding—for example, if the screen is frozen or if apps are not loading—or performing very slowly, the best solution is usually to perform a reset.\no App reset: use this if a particular app is not responding. In iOS®, double-click Home twice to open the multitasking toolbar then tap-and-hold the app and\nclick the Stop icon that appears when it starts jiggling. In Android™, you can\nmanage an app's cached data and access a Force Stop option through\nSettings→Applications→Manage Applications.\n• Restart/"soft" reset/power cycle: essentially rebooting the device (without losing any settings or data). Holding the Sleep/Wake/Power button down for a few seconds brings up a menu prompting the user to turn off the device. When troubleshooting, leave the device powered off for a minute then restart by holding the Sleep button again.\n• Forced restart: if the touchscreen is not responding to input and you cannot perform a power cycle normally, you can force the device to turn off. On an Android device, hold down the Sleep/Wake/Power button for 10 seconds; in iOS, hold Home+Sleep for 10 seconds.\n• Factory reset/erase: this deletes any user data and settings and puts the device in its "vanilla" factory state. In iOS, use Settings→General→Reset→Erase All Content and Settings Settings→Backup & reset→Factory data reset.\n\nNote: These procedures can vary from device-to-device so always check the instructions. If you cannot get an ordinary screen in Android, check the vendor documentation for the hardware buttons to use to get to a boot recovery screen (from a powered off state, Power+Volume Down is typical). iOS can be booted in recovery mode by holding the Home button when connecting the device to iTunes over USB.\n\n• For email issues, use the email client or encryption program's support documentation to find out how to install or locate the appropriate certificate.\nTag: C1 L8 TC

Activity 8-4\nTroubleshooting Common Laptop\n\nSCENARIO\nAnswer the following questions to check your understanding of the topic.\n\nQuestion 1. You are troubleshooting a laptop display. If the laptop can display an image on an external monitor but not the built-in one, which component do you know is working, and can you definitively say which is faulty?\n\nThe graphics adapter is working. The problem must exist either in the cabling to the built-in screen or with a screen component, such as an inverter, backlight, or the display panel itself. Further tests will be required to identify which (though it may be quicker to replace the whole screen assembly).\n\nQuestion 2. You received a user complaint about a laptop being extremely hot to the touch. What actions should you take in response to this issue?\n\nOverheating can be a sign that dust and dirt is restricting the necessary airflow within the device, so start by cleaning the ventilation duct with compressed air, and then make sure that the device is getting proper air circulation around the outside of the case.\n\nQuestion 3. A user complains that their Bluetooth keyboard, which has worked for the last year, has stopped functioning. What would you suggest is the problem?\n\nThe batteries in the keyboard have run down—replace them.\n\nQuestion 4. A user working in graphics design has just received a new laptop. The user phones to say that performance with the graphics program in the office is fine but dismal when he takes the laptop to client meetings. What could be the cause?\n\nThe laptop could be using reduced performance settings to conserve battery\nlife.\n\nQuestion 5. A laptop user reports that they are only getting about two hours of use out of the battery compared to about three hours when the laptop was first supplied to them. What do you suggest?\n\nBatteries lose maximum charge over time. It may be possible to recondition the battery or to use power saving features, but the only real way to restore maximum battery life is to buy a new battery.\n\nQuestion 6. A laptop user is complaining about typing on their new laptop. They claim that the cursor jumps randomly from place-to-place. What might be the cause of this?\n\nThe user could be touching the touchpad while typing, or vibrations could be affecting the touchpad. Update the driver, or reduce the sensitivity/disable touch and tap events.\nTag: C1 L8 TC A8-4

Summary\nIn this lesson, you performed support and troubleshooting routines on laptop computers. Familiarity with using various laptop features and technologies, as well as installing, configuring, and troubleshooting laptop components and behavior, will no doubt contribute to your success as an A+ support technician.\n\nQuestion: In your professional experience, have you supported laptop computers? If not, what kind of experience do you have with using them?\n\nAnswers will vary, and experience levels can range from no experience at all to power users who are very comfortable with using laptops and the technologies used with them.\n\nQuestion: Of the common laptop issues discussed in this lesson, which do you expect to encounter most often? Briefly explain your response.\n\nAnswers will vary, but might include dealing with display issues, particularly in situations where users use their laptops at the office and on the road, where different external monitors need to be taken into account.\nTag: C1 L8 SUMMARY
