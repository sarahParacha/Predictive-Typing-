Lesson 3\nInstalling, Configuring, and Troubleshooting Storage Devices\n\nLESSON INTRODUCTION\nAs a computer technician, your responsibilities are likely to include installing and maintaining many different types of computer components, including storage devices. By identifying the various types of storage devices that can be found in most personal computers, you will be better prepared to select, install, and maintain storage devices in personal computers. Data storage comes in a variety of types and sizes and for different purposes. Temporary data storage in RAM and permanent storage on hard disk drives, optical drives (CD/DVD/Blu-ray™), and flash memory drives and cards are the main types of storage you will encounter.\n\nLESSON OBJECTIVES\nIn this lesson, you will:\n• Install system memory.\n• Install and configure mass storage devices.\n• Install and configure removable storage devices.\n• Configure RAID.\n• Troubleshoot storage device issues.\ntag: C1 L3

Topic A\nInstall System Memory\n\nEXAM OBJECTIVES COVERED\n1001-3.3 Given a scenario, install RAM types.\n\nJust as some people say you can never be too rich, you can never have too much memory. Adding memory is one of the simplest and most cost-effective ways to increase a computer's performance, whether it is on a brand-new system loaded with high-performance applications or an older system that performs a few basic tasks.\ntag: C1 L3 TA

SYSTEM MEMORY\nSystem memory is the main storage area for programs and data when the computer is running. System memory is a type of volatile memory called Random Access Memory (RAM). System memory is necessary because it is much faster than accessing data in a mass storage system, such as a hard disk. System memory provides a fast storage medium for the operating system and applications but it is volatile, meaning that data cannot be stored without a power supply.\n\n(https://4sorcero.s3.amazonaws.com/byteback/core_1/fig_core_1_114.png)\nCPU, cache, and RAM are fast but volatile; mass storage and removable storage devices provide slower but permanent data retrieval. (Image by phadventure © 123RF.com.)\n\nNote: Non-volatile memory does not require a constant power source to store data. Examples include read-only memory (ROM) and flash memory.\n\nA large quantity of system memory is essential for running a PC. It determines its ability to work with multiple applications at the same time and larger files. Each new generation of software tends to take up more memory space. If there is not enough system RAM, the memory space can be extended by using disk space (virtual memory), but as noted previously, accessing the disk is very slow compared to accessing RAM.\ntag: C1 L3 TA FIGURE

RAM TYPES\nSeveral different RAM technologies have been used for system memory in PCs over the years.\n\n(https://4sorcero.s3.amazonaws.com/byteback/core_1/table_core_1_115a.png)\n\nRAM Type | Description\nDynamic RAM (DRAM):  DRAM stores each data bit as an electrical charge within a single bit cell. A bit cell consists of a capacitor to hold a charge (the cell represents 1 if there is a charge and 0 if there is not) and a transistor to read the contents of the capacitor.\nThe electrical charge gradually dissipates, causing the memory cell to lose its information. In order to preserve the information, dynamic memory has to be refreshed periodically by accessing each bit cell at regular intervals. The refresh cycles slow down the operation of DRAM but it supports high densities (more MB per memory module) and is relatively low cost.\nMany types of DRAM have been developed and become obsolete.\n\nSynchronous DRAM (SDRAM): In the mid-1990s, variants of SDRAM were used for system memory. SDRAM is so-called because it is synchronized to the system clock. It has a 64-bit data bus. Consequently, if the bus is running at 66 MHz, the bandwidth available to an SDRAM memory controller is 66.6*64 or 4266 megabits per second. Dividing by 8 gives the bandwidth in megabytes per second (533 MBps).\n\nSome notable RAM vendors include Kingston , Crucial™ (Micron), Corsair, PNY, and\nIntegral™.\ntag: C1 L3 TA TABLE

DDR SDRAM\nDouble Data Rate SDRAM (DDR SDRAM) is an updated type of SDRAM (released to market in 2001) where data is transferred twice in one cycle ("double-pumped"). There are four DDR standards, matching different system clock speeds.\n\n(https://4sorcero.s3.amazonaws.com/byteback/core_1/table_core_1_115b.png)\n(https://4sorcero.s3.amazonaws.com/byteback/core_1/table_core_1_116a.png)\n\nRAM Type | Memory Clock (MHz) | Bus Clock (MHz) | Data Rate (MT/s) | Transfer Rate (Gbps)\nDDR-200/PC-1600 100 100 200 1.6\nDDR-266/PC-2100 133 133 266 2.1\nDDR-333/PC-2700 167 167 333 2.7\nDDR-400/PC-3200 200 200 400 3.2\n\nSDRAM is referred to by the bus clock speed (PC100, PC133, and so forth). DDR chips are labeled using the maximum theoretical bandwidth (PC1600, PC2100, and so on) largely for marketing reasons. For example, consider DDR-200 PC-1600 memory:\n• The internal memory clock speed and I/O bus speed are both 100 MHz.\n• The data rate is double this as there are two operations per clock "tick." This is expressed in units called MegaTransfers per Second (200 MT/s). This gives the DDR-200 designation.\n• The peak transfer rate is 1600 MBps (200 MT/s x 8 bytes per transfer). This gives the PC-1600" designation. 1600 MBps is equivalent to 1.6 GBps. Note that the peak transfer rate does not represent "real world" performance; it is a maximum\ntheoretical rate.\ntag: C1 L3 TA TABLE

DDR2/DDR3/DDR4 SDRAM\nDDR has been superseded by DDR2 (from 2003), DDR3 (from 2007), and DDR4 (from 2014) SDRAM. These increase bandwidth by multiplying the bus speed, as opposed to the speed at which the actual memory chips work. This produces scalable speed improvements without making the chips too unreliable or too hot.\n\nThe drawback is increased latency, as data takes longer to access on each chip. Latency is offset by improving the memory circuitry.\n\n(https://4sorcero.s3.amazonaws.com/byteback/core_1/table_core_1_116b.png)\n\nMemory Clock Bus Clock Data Rate Transfer Rate\nRAM Type (MHz) (MHz) (MT/s) (Gbps)\nDDR2 100 to 266 200 to 533 400 to 1066 3.2 to 8.533\nDDR3 100 to 266 400 to 1066 800 to 2133 6.4 to 17.066\nDDR4 200 to 400 800 to 1600 1600 to 3200 12.8 to 25.6\n\nThe following represent specific examples of DDR standards:\n• DDR2-1066/PC28500—the memory works at 266 MHz and the bus at 533 MHz, which with the double data rate gives 1066 MT/s and nominal transfer rate of 8.533 GBps. This is the best available DDR2 standard.\n• DDR3-1600/PC312800—the memory works at 200 MHz and the bus at 800 MHz, which with the double data rate gives 1600 MT/s and nominal transfer rate of 12.8 GBps.\n• DDR4-1600/PC4-12800—the memory works at 200 MHz and the bus at 800 MHz, which with the double data rate gives 1600 MT/s and nominal transfer rate of 12.8 GBps. The only advantage over DDR3-1600 is the lower voltage, reducing power consumption.\n• DDR4-2400/PC4-19200—the memory works at 300 MHz and the bus at 1200 MHz, which with the double data rate gives 2400 MT/s and nominal transfer rate of 19.2 GBps, exceeding anything available for DDR3.\n\nNote: Clock speeds ending 33 or 66 are usually rounded down; technically they are 33⅓ and 66⅔ . In the case of DDR2-667, the memory manufacturers just didn't like the look of DDR2-666" so they rounded up.\n\nNote: When specifying high performance RAM you may want to compare the performance timings. These are quoted as a series of numbers in the form 5-5-5-15. Each number represents a different timing statistic. The lower the numbers, the better the performance. Each DDR standard has timing variants. For example, DDR3-1333G has 8-8-8-12 timing, whereas DDR3-1600G8 has 8-8-8-10 and DDR3-1600K has 11-11-11-13.\n\nNote: You may also come across GDDRx memory, which is a type of DDRx optimized for use on graphics cards.\ntag: C1 L3 TA TABLE

MEMORY MODULES\nA RAM module, or memory module, is a printed circuit board that holds a group of memory chips that act as a single unit. Memory modules reside in slots on the motherboard, and they are removable and replaceable. Memory modules are defined by their design and by the number and type of chips they contain.\n\nDUAL INLINE MEMORY MODULES\nDDR for desktop system memory is packaged in 184-pin Dual Inline Memory Module (DIMMs). The notches (keys) on the module prevent it from being inserted into a slot the wrong way around.\n\n(https://4sorcero.s3.amazonaws.com/byteback/core_1/fig_core_1_117.png)\nSDRAM packaged in 168-pin DIMMs. (Image © 123RF.com.)\n\nNote: Memory slots look similar to expansion slots but have catches on each end to secure the memory modules.\n\nDDR2 and DDR3 are both packaged in 240-pin DIMMs but are not compatible. The modules and slots are keyed differently to prevent a module from being inserted into an incompatible slot. Faster modules typically feature heatsinks, because of the higher clock speeds.\n\nDDR4 DIMMs have 288 pins. The modules are the same size as previous standards but the pins are more closely spaced. Again, the key position prevents a DDR4 module from being inserted into an incompatible DDR3 or DDR2 motherboard slot. DDR4 works at 1.2 V so is more power-efficient than previous standards.\n\n(https://4sorcero.s3.amazonaws.com/byteback/core_1/table_core_1_118.png)\n\nRAM Type | Pins | Voltage\nDDR       184 2.5 to 2.6V\nDDR2      240 1.8 to 1.9V\nDDR3      240 1.35 to 1.5V\nDDR4      288 1.2V\n\nLAPTOP MEMORY\nLaptop RAM is packaged in a smaller module called Small Outline DIMM (SODIMM). Both DDR and DDR2 use 200-pin packages, but the key position for DDR2 is slightly different to prevent insertion in a slot designed for DDR. DDR3 uses a 204-pin package while DDR4 is 260-pin.\n\nThe memory is typically fitted into slots that pop-up at a 45º angle to allow the chips to be inserted or removed.\n\n(https://4sorcero.s3.amazonaws.com/byteback/core_1/fig_core_1_118.png)\nSODIMM. (Image © 123RF.com.)\n\nDUAL-CHANNEL MEMORY\nIn the 2000s, the increasing speed and architectural improvements of CPU technologies led to memory becoming a bottleneck to system performance. To address this, Intel  and AMD developed a dual-channel memory architecture for DDRx RAM. Dual-channel was originally used primarily on server-level hardware but is commonly being employed on desktop systems and laptops too.\n\nSingle-channel memory means that there is one 64-bit bus between the CPU and RAM. With a dual-channel memory controller, there can effectively be two pathways through the bus to the CPU, meaning that 128 bits of data can be transferred per transaction" rather than 64 bits. In fact, in most configurations they continue to operate as two independent 64-bit pathways, but this still increases the bandwidth available. Ordinary RAM modules are used (that is, there are no "dual-channel" DDR memory modules).\n\nNote: DDRx memory is sold in "kits" for dual-channel applications but there is nothing special about the modules themselves, other than being identical.\n\n(https://4sorcero.s3.amazonaws.com/byteback/core_1/fig_core_1_119.png)\nMotherboard DIMM slots (dual channel). Slots 1 and 3 (black slots) make up one channel, while slots 2 and 4 (grey slots) make up a separate channel. (Image © 123RF.com.)\n\nFor example, a dual-channel motherboard might have four DIMM slots arranged in color-coded pairs. Each pair represents one channel; each slot represents one of the two sockets in each channel. The memory modules installed should be identical in terms of speed and capacity. If only two slots are used, to enable dual-channel, the modules must be installed in socket 1 of each channel. You will need to consult the system documentation carefully to identify the appropriate slots to use. For motherboards supporting Intel CPUs and some AMD CPUs, the first sockets in both channels are slots 1 and 3. For most AMD CPU-based motherboards, it would mean filling slots 1 and 2. Unfortunately, there is no standardized color-coding. As well as using different colors, some motherboard manufacturers use the same color for the same channel; others use the same color for the same socket. Check the documentation carefully.\n\nAdding an odd number of modules or adding mismatched DIMMs will cause the system to operate in single-channel mode. Dual-channel mode may also need to be enabled via the PC firmware's system setup program.\n\nSome of Intel's CPUs and supporting chipsets have triple- or quadruple-channel memory controllers. AMD is starting to release quadruple-channel controllers too. In these architectures, if the full complement of modules is not installed, the system will revert to dual- or single-channel operation.\n\nPARITY AND ECC RAM\nMotherboards used to use a simple error detection method called parity checking. Each byte of data in memory is accompanied by a ninth bit. This bit is set to 1 or 0 to make the total number of bits set to 1 in the byte an odd or even number, depending on the type of parity checking being performed. When the byte is read, its parity is checked to ensure that the parity value is still odd (or even). If this is not the case, a bit must have become corrupted.\n\nSystem memory for most desktops is non-parity; that is, it does not perform error checking (except for the startup memory count). For systems that require a high level of reliability (such as workstations and servers),Error Checking and Correcting (ECC) memory is available. ECC memory is enhanced parity circuitry that can detect internal data errors and make corrections. ECC will detect and correct single-bit errors and allow the system to continue functioning normally. It will also detect errors of 2, 3 or 4 bits but will not correct them; instead, it will generate an error message and halt the system.\n\nECC memory has an extra chip and a 72-bit data bus rather than 64-bit. The motherboard must support the use of ECC memory modules (and the option to use them must typically be enabled in system setup). ECC memory cannot be mixed with non-ECC modules.\n\nNote: An ECC DIMM will have an odd number of memory chips, whereas non-parity DIMMs will have an even number of memory chips.\ntag: C1 L3 TA FIGURE

MEMORY INSTALLATION AND UPGRADE\nUpgrading the memory is a common task for any PC technician. If the motherboard supports it but the system is not configured to use it, enabling a dual-channel configuration is the best way of extracting more performance from existing components. Increasing the bus speed would require purchasing a new motherboard and memory modules (and possibly CPU).\n\nNote: When you are purchasing a computer, it is a good idea to get the fastest memory bus you can afford, as this is the component that is most difficult to upgrade later.\ntag: C1 L3 TA

MEMORY COMPATIBILITY ISSUES\nIn terms of compatibility, always consult the motherboard user guide, but consider the following general guidelines:\n• The DIMM format must match the motherboard (you cannot install DDR modules in DDR2 slots, for instance).\n• Different capacity modules can be installed (with the exception of most multi-channel configurations).  Most vendors recommend installing the largest module in the lowest numbered slot.\n• Modules from different vendors can be mixed, though this may cause problems with multi-channel configurations.\n• For best performance, the modules should be the same speed as the motherboard. Different speeds can be mixed; that is, you can add modules that are faster or slower than the motherboard slots or mix modules of different speeds. The system will only operate at the best speed supported by all installed components (memory modules and controller), so this is not generally a good idea.\n• For best performance and reliability, configure multi-channel systems with identical memory modules for each channel.\n• ECC memory cannot be mixed with non-parity memory and must be supported by the motherboard. Similarly, registered memory cannot be mixed with unbuffered the modules and must be supported by the motherboard.\n\nMemory modules are quite easy to insert and remove (unless cabling within the case makes them inaccessible). The key point here is to ensure that the memory is suitable for the system and in the correct configuration.\ntag: C1 L3 TA

Activity 3-1\nDiscussing System Memory Installation\n\nSCENARIO\nAnswer the following questions to check your understanding of the content presented\n\nQuestion 1. What are the principal characteristics of DRAM technology?\n\nAnswer 1. Each cell in Dynamic RAM must be refreshed periodically to preserve its charge. It is high density and low cost.\n\nQuestion 2. Why is Synchronous DRAM so-called?\n\nAnswer 2. Because it works at the same speed as the motherboard.\n\nQuestion 3. What is the clock speed of PC2100 DDR SDRAM?\n\nAnswer 3. 133 MHz.\n\nQuestion 4. How many pins are there on a DIMM stick of DDR2 SDRAM?\n\nAnswer 4. 240\n\nQuestion 5. How can you distinguish memory slots on the motherboard?\n\nAnswer 5. They have plastic clips at either end.\n\nQuestion 6. How is laptop system memory typically packaged?\n\nAnswer 6. SODIMM\n\nQuestion 7. You are configuring a system with dual-channel memory. You have two modules and there are four slots. How would you determine which slots to use?\n\nAnswer 7. Check the system guide—most Intel boards would require the use of slots 1 and 3 to use both channels, but it's best not to proceed without consulting the vendor's documentation.\n\nQuestion 8. Your PC's system bus is 800 MHz. You have one 1 GB stick of PC3-12800 installed already. You have a 1 GB stick of PC3-8500 available. Should you add it to the system?\n\nAnswer 8. You should realize that the whole memory bus will operate at the slower speed, but otherwise there is no definitive answer—it does depend on how the PC is used. The performance benefits of more RAM probably outweigh the speed penalty in most circumstances, though.\n\nQuestion 9. Additional memory was installed in a user's system, and now it will not boot. What steps would you take to resolve this job ticket?\n\nAnswer 9. First, verify that the correct memory type was installed on the system and in the correct configuration (consider whether dual-channel memory was installed in the correct slots). Check that the new memory module is seated properly in its slot. Try swapping memory around in the memory slots.\ntag: C1 L3 TA A3-1

Activity 3-2\nUpgrading Memory\n\nBEFORE YOU BEGIN\nYour instructor will give you a system memory module or kit to install. Remember that memory modules are particularly susceptible to ESD, so handle the modules carefully by the plastic edges and avoid touching the chips.\n\nPerform this activity on your WORKBENCH PC.\n\nSCENARIO\nAdding extra system memory is one of the simplest (and cheapest) means of improving system performance. More memory means less slow pagefile access when multiple applications are running or when large files are being manipulated.\n\n1. Use the Windows System Properties page and the CPUID CPU-Z utility to report system information and configuration.\na) Open System Properties to confirm the amount of RAM currently installed.\nb) Run the CPUID CPU-Z utility by using its desktop shortcut and select Yes when prompted by User Account Control (UAC).\nThe first tab shows information about the CPU.\nc) Select the Memory tab.\n\n(https://4sorcero.s3.amazonaws.com/byteback/core_1/fig_core_1_124.png)\nThis tab shows the total amount of system memory, its type and timings as well as whether it is configured in dual-channel mode.\n\nd) Make a note of the DRAM frequency:\ne) Select the SPD tab.\n\n(https://4sorcero.s3.amazonaws.com/byteback/core_1/fig_core_1_125.png)\n\nSPD stands for Serial Presence Detect. This chip reports the configuration of a memory module installed in a particular slot on the motherboard. You can use this to find out if there are spare slots available for upgrade; useful if your system documentation has not been kept up-to-date.\nf) Note which slot(s) the memory module(s) are installed in, and if the system is in dual-channel mode which slots comprise sockets in different channels.\n• Slots where memory installed: ____________________________\n• Slots comprising sockets in different channels: ____________________________\ng) Optionally, select the Graphics tab to view information about the video adapter and any graphics memory it might have installed.\nh) Select Close.\n\n2. Perform a memory module upgrade, and verify the procedure.\na) Power down the PC, disconnect the power cable, and take the usual ESD precautions.\nb) Remove the case cover.\nc) Confirm that there is a free memory slot and that the memory you have been given is of the correct type.\n\nNote: If your instructor has additional memory available for you to install in the PC, they will give it to you now. If not, you can remove the existing memory module and reinstall it. Be sure to follow ESD best practices when you work with RAM modules.\n\nd) Release the clips on the memory slot, and push the module into place, taking care to handle it by the plastic parts, rather than touching the chips.\nThe clips should snap back into place when the module is properly inserted.\ne) Double-check that the module is seated correctly, and then close the system case.\nf) Reconnect the power cable and start the PC. As the PC boots, look to see if there is a memory check (most computers skip this sort of check these days). If there is an error, power off the PC again, and check that you have seated the module correctly.\ng) Log on to Windows and double-check in System Properties that the RAM has been\nrecognized.\nh) Run the CPUID CPU-Z utility again and check the memory configuration. Is it still running at the same speed?\nAnswers will vary depending on the DIMM used to upgrade the PC.\ni) Close the System Information and CPU-Z windows.\n\n3. If necessary, uninstall the added memory and return it to your instructor.\na) Power down the PC, disconnect the power cable, and take the usual ESD precautions.\nb) Uninstall the extra module and hand it back to your instructor.\nc) Close the system case, reconnect the power cable, and restart the PC.\nd) Log in to Windows.\ntag: C1 L3 TA A3-2

Topic B\nInstall and Configure Mass Storage Devices\n\nEXAM OBJECTIVES COVERED\n1001-3.1 Explain basic cable types, features, and their purposes.\n1001-3.4 Given a scenario, select, install and configure storage devices.\n\nMass storage devices such as hard disks are one of the most common system components you will install. In this topic, you will install and configure hard disk drives (HDDs) and solid state drives (SSDs). Users rely on local persistent storage devices to keep their applications and data current and available. As a CompTIA® A+® technician, your responsibilities are likely to include installing and configuring different types of storage devices to provide your users with the data-storage capabilities that they need to perform their jobs.\ntag: C1 L3 TB

STORAGE DEVICES\nSystem memory provides a fast storage medium for the operating system and applications but is volatile, meaning that data cannot be stored without a power supply. Non-volatile storage devices (or mass storage devices) hold data when the system is powered off. Removable mass storage devices and removable media allow data to be archived from the PC and transferred between PCs.\n\nMass storage devices use magnetic, optical, or solid state technology to store data. At least some storage devices are fitted as internal components. In the case of internal devices that use removable storage media, the drive is positioned at the front of the case so that the media can be inserted and removed. Hard drives do not need user access and so do not need to be positioned near a faceplate.\n\nExternal storage devices are also popular for backup and data transfer or to provide a drive type not available as an internal unit. A device such as an external hard drive would typically be connected to the computer via a USB port.\ntag: C1 L3 TB

HARD DISK DRIVES\nEven with the advances in the speed and capacity of other types of storage technology, the hard disk drive (HDD) remains the primary method of persistent storage for PC data. On a workstation PC, the hard disk drive will store the operating system files, application program files, system software files (such as drivers), and user data. On a server PC, the hard disks will store individual user files and shared sources of information, such as databases. Advances in hard disk technology have enabled disks of up to 8 terabytes (8000 GB) to be produced, although smaller capacities are more common for performance and reliability reasons.\n\n(https://4sorcero.s3.amazonaws.com/byteback/core_1/fig_core_1_128.png)\nHDD with drive circuitry and casing removed showing 1) Platters; 2) Spindle; 3) Read/write heads; 4) Actuator. (Image by mkphotoshu © 123RF.com.)\n\nIn an HDD, data is stored on several metal or glass platters that are coated with a magnetic substance. The top and bottom of each platter is accessed by its own read/ write head, moved by an actuator mechanism.\n\nThese heads do not actually touch the surface of the platters. The platters are mounted on a spindle and spun at high speed and the heads "float" above them at a distance of less than a millionth of an inch. The disk unit is kept sealed to maintain a constant air pressure (important for keeping the drive heads at the correct distance from the platters) and to prevent the entry of dust.\n\nEach side of each platter is divided into circular tracks and each track contains several sectors, each with a capacity of 512 bytes. This low-level formatting is also referred to as the drive geometry.\n\nThere are two main formats for HDDs. 3.5" units are the mainstream type used in PCs. 2.5" form factors are used for laptops and as portable external drives. There is also a 1.8" form factor but it is not widely used. 2.5" HDDs can also vary in height, with 15 mm, 9.5 mm, 7 mm, and 5 mm form factors available.\ntag: C1 L3 TB FIGURE

DRIVE BAYS AND CADDIES\nA drive can be fitted using a caddy. You screw the drive into the caddy and then screw the caddy into the case. A caddy can also allow you to fit a drive of a different size to the bay. For example, you can fit a 2.5" drive in a 3.5" bay by using an adapter caddy. Some caddies use rails so that you can pull the drive out without having to open the case.\ntag: C1 L3 TB

HDD PERFORMANCE FACTORS\nSeveral factors determine overall hard disk performance. One factor is the speed at which the disks can spin, measured in Revolutions Per Minute (RPM). The higher the RPM, the faster the drive is. High performance drives are rated at 15,000 or 10,000 rpm; average performance is 7,200 or 5,400 rpm.\n\nRPM is one factor determining access time (measured in milliseconds), which is the delay that occurs as the read/write head locates a particular track position (seek time) and sector location (rotational latency) on the drive. A high performance drive will have an access time below 3 ms; a typical drive might have an access time of around 6 ms.\n\nThe internal transfer rate (or data or disk transfer rate) of a drive is a measure of how fast read/write operations are performed on the disk platters. A 15 K drive should support an internal transfer rate of up to about 180 MBps, while 7.2 K drives will be around 110 MBps. The external transfer rate (often simply described as the transfer rate) measures how fast data can be transferred to the CPU across the bus. Cache memory can help to sustain better transfer rates. A high performance disk may feature an 8 MB or better cache.\n\nNote: Generally, the burst transfer rate is quoted. This is the maximum possible transfer rate under ideal conditions and cannot be sustained over a long period.\n\nThe other crucial factor that impacts HDD performance is reliability. Reliability is rated by various statistics, including Early-life Failure Rate, Mean Time Between Failure (MTBF),  which is the number of hours that a device should operate (under optimum conditions) before a critical incident can be expected, and life expectancy, which is the duration for which the device can be expected to remain reliable. All drives now feature Self-Monitoring Analysis and Reporting Technology (S.M.A.R.T.) to pass status information and alerts back to monitoring software. This can provide advance warning that a drive is about to fail. Some of the major hard drive vendors include Seagate, Western Digital, Maxtor, Hitachi, Fujitsu, Toshiba, and Samsung.\ntag: C1 L3 TB

STORAGE ADAPTERS AND CABLES\nHost Bus Adapters (HBAs) provide a connection point for internal mass storage devices, such as hard drives, optical drives, and tape drives. The interface between the drive, host adapter, and the rest of the system is a type of bus. There used to be two main bus standards for attaching internal storage devices to a PC—Parallel ATA (PATA) and Small Computer System Interface (SCSI)—but these have now largely been replaced by SATA.\n\nNote: HBAs are also commonly referred to as drive controllers. Technically, the controller is the circuitry in the disk unit that allows it to put data on the bus, which the HBA shuttles to the CPU or RAM.\n\nSATA\nSerial Advanced Technology Attachment (SATA) is the standard means of attaching internal storage drives to a desktop PC. It has superseded the legacy Parallel ATA (PATA) technology.\n\nAs the name suggests, SATA transfers data in serial format. This allows for thin, flexible cables of up to 1 m (39"). The cables are terminated with compact 7-pin connectors. Each SATA host adapter port supports a single device. SATA is a hot swappable interface.  This means that a compatible drive can be connected or disconnected while the system is running.\n\n(https://4sorcero.s3.amazonaws.com/byteback/core_1/fig_core_1_130a.png)\nSATA connectors and ports (from left to right): SATA data; SATA power (with 3.3V orange wire). (Image © 123RF.com.)\n\nThe first commercially available SATA standard supported speeds of up to 1.5 Gbps. This standard was quickly augmented by SATA revision 2 (3 Gbps) and then SATA\nrevision 3 (6 Gbps).\n\n(https://4sorcero.s3.amazonaws.com/byteback/core_1/fig_core_1_130b.png)\nMotherboard SATA and legacy PATA/IDE ports. (Image © 123RF.com.)\n\nNote:  While SATA dominates the PC market, Serial Attached SCSI (SAS) is also very popular in the server market. It supports over 16,000 devices, offers point-to-point links (as opposed to shared bandwidth), has none of the termination issues that complicated legacy SCSI, and supports higher bandwidths (up to 12 Gbps).\ntag: C1 L3 TB

SOLID STATE DRIVES\nFlash memory is being incorporated onto a new generation of Solid State Drives (SSDs) designed to replicate or supplement the function of the hard drive.\n\n(https://4sorcero.s3.amazonaws.com/byteback/core_1/fig_core_1_131.png)\nA 2.5" form factor solid state drive with SATA interface. (Image © 123RF.com.)\n\nThe advantages of flash memory-based SSDs are:\n• The lack of moving parts makes them quieter, more power efficient, and less prone to catastrophic failure or damage due to shock (dropping or moving a device rapidly, for instance).\n• Read times are better because seek time and consequently the effect of file fragmentation is eliminated.\n• They are less susceptible to data loss in the event of power failure.\n• Most drives still feature DRAM-based write cache to improve performance. In the event of a power failure, unwritten cache would be lost. However, the DRAM cache may be backed up by a battery to cover this eventuality.\n\nThe main disadvantage is the high cost; a 64 GB SSD costs a bit more than a 2 TB HDD (a 1 TB SSD can cost the same as a top-end server).\ntag: C1 L3 TB

SSD INTERFACES AND FORM FACTORS\nAn SSD might be installed as the computer's only internal drive or as a system drive for use with an additional hard drive. The SSD would normally be used to install the OS and software applications, whereas the HDD would be used for user data files. In this configuration, both drives are available to the user.\n\nAn SSD might be installed to a SATA port as with a mechanical HDD. This is any easy way to upgrade the 2.5" drive in a laptop as the device form factor is exactly the same. The main drawback is that the 6 Gbps SATA interface can be a bottleneck to the best performing SSDs. Consequently, modern SSDs often use the PCI Express (PCIe) bus directly. Where SATA uses the Advanced Host Controller Interface (AHCI) logical interface to communicate with the bus, PCIe-based SSDs use the Non-Volatile Memory Host Controller Interface Specification (NVMHCI) NVM Express or (NVMe)for short.\n\nA PCIe-based SSD can either be implemented as a regular PCIe adapter card or Add-in Card (AiC) or it can use the M.2 adapter interface. M.2 can use up to 4 PCIe lanes. Note that M.2 adapters are not hot-swappable or hot-pluggable. An M.2 adapter is considerably smaller than a PCIe adapter so the interface is often used on laptops as well as PC motherboards. M.2 supplies power over the bus so there is no need for a separate power cable. M.2 adapters can be different lengths (42 mm, 60 mm, 80 mm, or 110 mm), so you should check that any given adapter will fit on your motherboard. Labels indicate the adapter sizes supported.\n\nNote: Note that M.2 is a physical form factor and so you can obtain M.2 SSDs that use the SATA/AHCI bus. These will not perform as well as NVMe-based M.2 SSDs. On the motherboard, an M.2 socket may be able to support both types of drive or only one; check the documentation. The key position on the connector is different for SATA and NVMe models. Also note that M.2 can be used for wireless adapters too.\n\nNote: SATA 3.2 defines SATA Express (SATAe) as a means of interfacing with a 2-lane PCI Express bus. It uses a different connector, but the port is backwards-compatible with ordinary" SATA cabling. You might also come across the U.2 (or SFF-8369) interface. U.2 uses the same physical interface as SATA Express and is hot-swappable, but supports up to 4 PCIe lanes, like M.2.\ntag: C1 L3 TB

SSD PERFORMANCE FACTORS\nSSDs normally outperform HDDs but there are situations where they can perform worse than HDDs; when serving large (GB) files, for example. When making a detailed comparison between different types of storage technology, you need to compare performance against different types of data transfer. For example, read and write performance are not equivalent. There are also differences between sequential access (reading data from the same "block" as might happen when transferring a large file) and random access (reading data from different locations on the drive or transferring lots of small files for instance). Along with the data throughput and latency/access time, you may need to consider the number of Input/Output Operations per Second (IOPS) that can be achieved by a device for different kinds of data transfer operation.\n\nFlash chips are also susceptible to their own type of degradation over the course of many write operations, so the drive firmware and operating system must use leveling routines to prevent any single storage location from being overused and\noptimize the life of the device.\ntag: C1 L3 TB

HYBRID DRIVES\nSolid state storage may also be incorporated on a hybrid drive. In a hybrid drive, the SSD portion functions as a large cache, containing data that is accessed frequently. The magnetic disc is only spun up when non-cached data is accessed. Version 3.2 of the SATA standard defines a set of commands to allow the host computer to specify how the cache should be used (also referred to as host-hinted mode). Alternatively, the drive firmware can run self-optimizing routines. The user does not have direct control over files stored on the cache.\n\nDUAL-DRIVE CONFIGURATIONS\nAnother option is for separate SSD and HDD units to be installed in a dual-drive configuration. In this case, the system chipset and storage drivers, usually based on Intel Smart Response Technology (SRT), make the caching decisions. Again, the user does not have control over the use of the SSD.\n\nNote: SRT can only use caches up to 64 GB (at the time of writing). If the SSD is larger, SRT can reserve part of the drive for caching and the remainder of the capacity is then available to the user and can be manipulated via the OS disk and file management tools.\ntag: C1 L3 TB

LEGACY STORAGE TECHNOLOGIES\nWhile SATA is the dominant connection method for most drive types, you may come across systems using much older host bus adapters, such as IDE and SCSI. It is important that you know how to configure these older technologies.\n\nIDE/PATA\nThe Parallel Advanced Technology Attachment (PATA) interface was the principal mass storage interface for desktop PCs for many years. The interface was (and still is) also referred to as IDE (Integrated Drive Electronics) or EIDE (Extended IDE). As the name suggests, an EIDE bus uses parallel data transfers, meaning 16 bits is transferred for each clock tick.\n\nA motherboard supporting PATA may come with one or two host adapters or channels, called IDE1 and IDE2 or primary (PRI IDE) and secondary (SEC IDE). A single PATA channel is now more typical if the motherboard also supports SATA. Each PATA channel supports two devices, 0 and 1, though they are usually labeled master and slave.\n\nA PATA drive features a 40-pin port but typically uses 80-wire shielded cables, which are required for UDMA4 or better transfer modes. PATA cable is supposed to be up to 46 cm (18") long. Each PATA cable typically has three connectors, one for the motherboard and one for each device. Most cables are "Cable Select," allowing the master and slave device to be identified by the position of the connector on the cable. Pin 1 on the cable must be oriented with pin 1 on the connector. On the cable, pin 1 is identified with a red stripe. The connectors are also keyed to prevent them from being inserted the wrong way around.\n\n(https://4sorcero.s3.amazonaws.com/byteback/core_1/fig_core_1_133.png)\nPATA cable with master (black), slave (grey), and motherboard (blue) connectors. The red strip indicates pin 1 on the cable. Note: There is currently a movement to generally rename the "master slave" terminology to combinations like "parent/child" or "leader/follower." (Image © 123RF.com.)\n\nPATA standards have evolved over the years. This table lists some of the later ATA standards.\n\n(https://4sorcero.s3.amazonaws.com/byteback/core_1/table_core_1_133.png)\n(https://4sorcero.s3.amazonaws.com/byteback/core_1/table_core_1_134a.png)\n\nInterface Standard | DMA Mode | Max. Transfer Rate(MBps) | Special Features\nATA/ATAPI-4 UDMA 2 (Ultra 33 Ultra DMA, 80-ATA/33) conductor cable,and cyclic redundancy checking\nATA/ATAPI-5 UDMA 4 (Ultra 66  ATA/66)\nATA/ATAPI-6 UDMA 5 (Ultra ATA/ 100 48-bit LBA 100) expansion, and disk noise reduction\nATA/ATAPI-7 UDMA 6 (Ultra ATA/ 133 Multimedia 133) streaming\n\nTable notes:\n• ATAPI stands for ATA Packet Interface and is an extension to ATA to support CD/DVD drives and tape drives.\n• DMA (Direct Memory Access) mode refers to the way that data is transferred to and from system memory.\n• In the early days of the EIDE interface, BIOS versions severely restricted maximum drive capacity. Driver software in the OS now handles drive addressing. Logical Block Addressing (LBA) is a method of telling the drive how to address a particular place on the disk surface. 48-bit LBA supports drives up to a (theoretical) 144 Petabytes.\n\n\nSCSI\nSmall Computer Systems Interface (SCSI) is another parallel bus. One SCSI Host Bus Adapter (HBA) can control multiple devices, attached by internal ribbon cables or external SCSI cables. The SCSI standard also defines a command language that allows the host adapter to identify which devices are connected to the bus and how they are accessed.\n\nSCSI was used to connect peripherals of different types but is now only associated with the connection of storage devices. As with IDE, you will not find SCSI on new systems, but should know how to configure it in case you encounter any legacy systems still depending on it. A SCSI port is denoted by the following symbol: (https://4sorcero.s3.amazonaws.com/byteback/core_1/fig_core_1_134.png)\n\nThe main SCSI standards are described in this table.\n\n(https://4sorcero.s3.amazonaws.com/byteback/core_1/table_core_1_134b.png)\n(https://4sorcero.s3.amazonaws.com/byteback/core_1/table_core_1_135.png)\n\nInterface Protocol | Standard | Bandwidth (MBps) | Bus Width (bits) | Max. CableLength (meters)\nSCSI-1 SCSI-1 5 8 • SE: 6 • LVD: NA • HVD: 25\nFast SCSI SCSI-2 10 8 • SE: 3 • LVD: NA • HVD: 25\nFast-Wide SCSI SCSI-2 20 16 • SE: 3 • LVD: NA • HVD: 25\nUltra SCSI SCSI-3 20 8 • SE: 1.5 • LVD: NA • HVD: 25\nUltra Wide SCSI SCSI-3 40 16 • SE: NA • LVD: NA • HVD: 25 • SE: NA • LVD: 12 • HVD: 25\nUltra2 Wide SCSI-3 80 16 • SE: NA • LVD: 12 • HVD: 25\nUltra3 SCSI (Ultra160 SCSI) SCSI-3 160 16 • SE: NA • LVD: 12 • HVD: NA\nUltra 320 SCSI SCSI-3 320 16 • SE: NA • LVD: 12 • HVD: NA\n\nGiven the number of different versions of the standard, SCSI configuration is relatively complex. SCSI devices were typically used on server-class hardware rather than on desktop PCs.\n• Host adapter—the SCSI host adapter must be installed and recognized by the system for devices to be detected. A third-party driver might have to be installed for the host adapter to be recognized.\n• Bus width—SCSI originally supported 8 devices (the host adapter counts as a device). Wide SCSI supports up to 16 devices.\n• Signaling—SCSI specifies three signaling methods. Most buses and devices use Low Voltage Differential (LVD). Single Ended (SE) devices can be added to an LVD bus, but it reduces the performance of the whole bus. H(igh)VD is incompatible with the other two and must not be mixed.\n• Termination—a SCSI bus must be terminated at both ends, usually by enabling termination on the first and last devices in the chain. Termination may either be enabled internally on the device by setting a switch or by physically connecting a terminator pack to a device or the host adapter.\n\nNote: There are passive and active terminators. Passive terminators are generally used with older devices (pre-Ultra SCSI). When installing a terminator pack, the terminator must match the signaling type (SE, LVD, HVD, or SE/LVD). Termination is also made more complex if there is a mix of narrow (8-bit) and wide (16-bit) devices on the bus.\n\n• ID—each SCSI device must be allocated a unique ID, from 0 to 7 (or 15 for wide SCSI). IDs may be allocated automatically or by setting a jumper or click-wheel on the device itself. The order of SCSI ID priorities (from highest to lowest) is 7 through to 0 then 15 through to 8.\n\nNote: The host adapter is usually set to 7 or 15. A bootable hard disk is usually allocated ID 0.\n\nThere were numerous SCSI connectors. Some of the most common were:\n• HD68—68-pin connectors used for internal and external ports. 68-pin adapters support Wide SCSI.\n• Single Connector Attachment (SCA)—an 80-pin connector that incorporates both a power connector and configuration wires, allowing for hot swappable drives.\ntag: C1 L3 TB FIGURE TABLE

GUIDELINES FOR INSTALLING MASS STORAGE DEVICES\nConsider these guidelines when installing mass storage devices.\n\nINSTALL MASS STORAGE DEVICES\nThere are several things to consider when you are installing an internal storage device in a computer system. It is not as simple as just plugging the device into the slot inside the case. Make sure you consider each factor before installation:\n\n• Does the computer have existing internal storage devices? Do you need to plan for the addition of another controller for an additional device? You might need to purchase an additional SATA controller before you can add another SATA device. In addition, make sure that the computer has an available slot for the controller.\n\n• Does the device need additional drivers installed? Make sure that you have the appropriate operating system device drivers to install the new storage device on the computer. If necessary, download the device drivers from the device manufacturer's website.\n\n• Does the computer have an available power supply cable to supply power to the device? If not, you can purchase splitters to enable two (or more) devices to be connected to a single power connection, but be aware of power consumption. The number of connectors approximates the available power, so make sure that the storage device will not cause the computer to exceed the capacity of its power supply.\n\n• Does the computer have an available drive bay for the storage device? Most hard drives require a 3.5-inch drive bay; most tape drives and optical drives require a 5.25-inch drive bay. If you want to install a hard drive in a 5.25-inch drive bay, you will need drive rails. Make sure you place the storage device where it will get good air flow to avoid overheating the device. Consider the placement of the drives inside the bays with the cable configurations. You may need to adjust the placement of the drives to match the order of cable connectors.\n\n• Do you have the necessary data cables to connect the storage device to the controller? You will need a SATA data cable for each hard drive in the PC. Other types of storage devices might require different types of data cables.\n\n• Does the placement of the device interrupt the air flow of the case? Make sure there is enough total air flow to handle whatever heat the new storage device will add to the computer.\n\nNote: When adding or removing storage devices (or performing any type of work inside the PC case), make sure that you take a backup of any data stored on local drives.\ntag: C1 L3 TB

Activity 3-4\nInstalling Storage Devices\n\nBEFORE YOU BEGIN\nTo complete this activity, you will need the following hardware components for your workbench PC. If you do not have these available, you can remove and reinstall the existing hardware:\n\n• A second hard drive or an optical drive and an empty drive bay.\n• An available power connection for the device you are adding to the system.\n• Optionally, rails to allow smaller drives to fit into larger drive bays.\n\nYou will perform this activity on your WORKBENCH PC.\n\nSCENARIO\nIn this activity, you will install an additional disk drive into your system. The type of disk you install will depend on the components available, so check with your instructor to see which of the following steps you should complete and for any additional instructions.\n\n1. List the type of removable storage devices in your PC and details such as model name or slot types.\n_______ Drive\n_______ Drive \n_______ Drive \n_______ Memory  Card Reader\n_______ Memory  Card Reader\n\nNote: You're likely to have an optical drive, one or more memory card readers, and one or more USB drives, as well as possible eSATA ports. Revise the left column as needed to distinctly identify each drive.\n\n2. Add a SATA hard drive and/or optical drive to your system. Depending on the motherboard, you may also need to install a host adapter.\na) Power off the system, unplug all the peripherals and power cord, and open the computer case.\nb) Examine the motherboard to determine whether there are any SATA ports.\nc) If there are no SATA ports, locate a free adapter slot, and remove the blanking plate. Install the SATA host adapter and screw it down.\nd) Locate an available drive bay, and determine if the bay is the same form factor as the drive. Secure the drive to it, using a caddy and rails if necessary.\ne) Connect the drive to an available SATA port using a SATA cable.\nf) Attach a power connector to the drive. You may need to obtain a Molex-SATA power converter from your instructor.\ng) Replace the cover on your PC and reboot it.\nh) Observe startup messages to check that the drive is detected. If the drive is not detected, check either that the onboard controller is enabled (through system setup) or that the host adapter has been recognized.\n\n3. If you installed a hard disk, complete the following steps to make a partition and format it so that the disk is usable. If you installed a removable storage device, just check that you can read some removable media using it.\na) Reboot the PC into Windows and log on. Press the Windows+X keys and select the Computer Management. Select the Disk Management tool.\nYour new disk should appear as Disk 1.\nb) In the Initialize Disk GPT dialog box, select OK and then select Next.\nc) Right-click the area of Unallocated Space and select New Simple Volume.\nd) Select Next.\ne) Select Primary Partition and select Next.\nf) Use the maximum amount of disk space. Select Next.\ng) Assign drive letter H. Select Next.\nh) Select the NTFS file system and use the partition label HOME. Check the box to perform a  quick format.\nSelect Next, and then select Finish.\ni) After the format is complete and the partition is marked healthy, test that it is accessible by copying some files to it from your C: drive.\nj) In Disk Management, right-click the volume and select Delete Volume. Select Yes to confirm.\n\n4. Reverse the steps above to uninstall the extra drive(s) plus any adapter cards that you installed and return them to your instructor.\ntag: C1 L3 TB A3-4

Topic C\nInstall and Configure Removable Storage\n\nEXAM OBJECTIVES COVERED\n1001-3.4 Given a scenario, select, install, and configure storage devices.\n1001-3.6 Explain the purposes and uses of various peripheral types.\n\nSometimes, the needs of the user are such that providing additional system memory and mass storage devices is not enough. Consider a situation where raw data is supplied to a user via a DVD, thumb drive, or flash memory card. How will the user get the information off the media and into their PC where they can work with it? In this topic, you will install and configure removable storage.\ntag: C1 L3 TC

REMOVABLE STORAGE\nRemovable storage can refer to either a storage device that can be removed, or storage media that is removable. Internal hard drives and Solid State Drives provide persistent storage for the computer's OS files, software applications, and user data files. Other types of persistent storage can be used as removable media. A removable disk or drive can be attached to a different computer to move or copy data files. Removable media is also used to make a backup.\n\nOPTICAL MEDIA\nCompact discs (CDs) and digital versatile discs (DVDs) are mainstream storage formats for consumer multimedia, such as music and video. Both formats have been adapted for data storage with PC systems. The CD/DVD drives used with PCs can also play consumer versions of the discs.\n• The data version of the CD-ROM (CD) became ubiquitous on PC systems as it has sufficient capacity (700 MB) to deliver most software applications.\n• DVD is an improvement on CD technology and delivers substantially more capacity (up to about 17 GB). DVDs are used for software installs and for games and multimedia.\n\nCOMPACT DISCS\nA CD is a layer of aluminum foil encased in protective plastic, which can also incorporate a label or screen-printed image on the non-playing side. The foil layer contains a series of pits and spaces in-between (called lands) arranged in a spiral. The changes between pits and lands are used to encode each bit. A standard CD is 120 mm in diameter and 1.2 mm thick. There are also 80 mm discs, which are playable in most CD-ROM drives.\n\nA recordable version of the CD (CD-R) was developed in 1999. Rather than a premastered layer of foil with pits and lands, CD-Rs feature a layer of photosensitive dye. A special laser is used to transform the dye, mimicking the pits and lands of a normal CD, in a process called burning. Most ordinary CD players and drives can read CD-Rs but they may not play back properly on older equipment. CD-R is a type of Write Once Read Many (WORM) media. Data areas once written cannot be overwritten. If there is space, a new session can be started on the disc. However, this makes the disc unreadable in older CD-ROM drives.\n\nA rewritable (or multisession) disc format (CD-RW) has also been developed. This uses a heat sensitive compound whose properties can be changed between crystalline and amorphous by a special laser. There is some concern over the longevity of recordable CD (and DVD) media. Cheaply manufactured discs have shown a tendency to degrade and become unusable (sometimes over the space of just a few years).\n\nNote: While the regular capacity of a CD is 700 MB, there are high capacity 800 MB (90 minute) and 860 MB (99 minute) discs that can be used with a CD writer that supports overburning. Note that overburning is more likely to produce disks with data or playback errors.\ntag: C1 L3 TC

DIGITAL VERSATILE DISCS\nCompared to CDs, DVDs have higher densities. DVDs are also thinner and can be dual-layer (DVD DL) and/or double-sided (DVD DS). Double-sided discs need to be turned over to play or record to the second side.\n\nDVDs also feature a higher transfer rate, with multiples of 1.32 MBps (equivalent to 9x CD speed). The fastest models feature 24x read and write speeds.\n\nLike CDs, there are recordable and rewritable versions of DVDs, some of which support dual layer recording. There are two slightly different standards for recordable and rewritable DVDs, referred to as DVD-R/DVD-RW versus DVD+R/DVD+RW. Most drives can read all formats but write in either + or - format. Many consumer DVD players can play DVD±R discs. An additional format, Panasonic's DVD-RAM, is not widely supported by computer DVD drives but is optimized for multiple write operations and so well suited to data storage. DVD±R supports dual layer and double-sided media, whereas DVD±RW supports double-sided media only.\ntag: C1 L3 TC

BLU-RAY DISCS\nBlu-ray Discs (BDs) have emerged as the next generation format for distributing consumer multimedia and can be used to distribute large applications, such as video games. Blu-ray is principally required to cope with the demands of High Definition video recording and playback. HD requires more bandwidth and storage space because it uses a much higher resolution picture (1920x1080 compared to 720x480 [NTSC] or 720x576 [PAL]) and better quality audio (digital surround sound).\n\nA Blu-ray Disc works on fundamentally the same principle as DVD but with a shorter wavelength laser (a 405 nm blue laser compared to DVD's 650 nm red laser). This means discs can be higher density, although the cost of components to make the drives is greater. The base speed for Blu-ray is 4.5 MBps and the maximum theoretical rate is 16x (72 MBps). 2x is the minimum required for movie playback.\n\nA standard BD has a capacity of 25 GB per layer; mini-discs (8 cm) can store 7.8 GB per layer. Dual-layer discs can store up to 50 GB and are readable in ordinary BD drives. Triple-layer 100 GB and quad-layer 128 GB (not currently re-recordable) discs are defined in the BD-XL specification. These require BD-XL compatible drives for writing and reading. There are currently no double-sided formats.\ntag: C1 L3 TC

DRM AND REGION CODING\nConsumer DVDs feature copy protection mechanisms such as Digital Rights Management (DRM) and region coding. Region coding, if enforced, means that a disc can only be used on a player from the same region.\nHere are the DVD region codes in use:\n• Region 0: No coding (playback is not restricted).\n• Region 1: Canada and the US.\n• Region 2: Europe, the Middle East, Japan, South Africa, and Egypt.\n• Region 3: SE Asia.\n• Region 4: South America, Australia, and New Zealand.\n• Region 5: Russia, parts of Africa, and parts of Asia.\n• Region 6: China.\n\nNote: The DVD drive region can be set via Device Manager.\n\n(https://4sorcero.s3.amazonaws.com/byteback/core_1/fig_core_1_143.png)\nThe DVD region supported by a PC DVD drive can be changed via Device Manager—though the firmware only permits a limited number of changes. (Screenshot used with permission from Microsoft.)\n\nSome DVD players are multi-region, but some discs feature protection mechanisms to disable playback in such machines. PC software is not usually region coded, with the exception of some PC game discs. Like DVDs, consumer Blu-ray Discs (BD-ROMs) are likely to be DRM-protected and may be region coded:\n• Region A: America, Japan, and SE Asia.\n• Region B: EMEA, Africa, Australia, and New Zealand.\n• Region C: Russia and Central Asia (including China).\ntag: C1 L3 TC FIGURE

OPTICAL DRIVES\nOptical drives include CD drives, DVD drives, and Blu-ray drives.\nOptical drives are considerably larger than hard disks (5.25" form factor). An internal unit would be installed to a 5.25" drive bay and connected to the motherboard via SATA data and power connectors. An external unit would be connected via USB (or possibly eSATA or Thunderbolt). External optical drives typically require their own power supply, provided via a supplied AC adapter. CD drives are rated according to their data transfer speed. The original drives had a data transfer rate of 150 KBps. Subsequently, drives have been available that offer multiples of the original rate; this would be around 52x for new models, offering transfer rates in excess of 7 MBps.\n\n(https://4sorcero.s3.amazonaws.com/byteback/core_1/fig_core_1_144.png)\nOptical disc drive. (Image © 123RF.com.)\n\nMany optical drives also function as recordable/rewritable CD burners (or writers). Such drives feature three speeds, always expressed as the Record/Rewrite/Read speed (for example, 24x/16x/52x). One feature to look out for on such drives is BURN-proof technology, which prevents discs being ruined by buffer under-run errors (where the software cannot supply the drive the data to write quickly enough).\n\nA CD drive consists of a spindle motor (to spin the disc), a laser and lens (to read the disc), and a tracking system to move the laser and lens assembly. The mechanism for inserting a CD is either tray or slot based. Slot-loading mechanisms have rollers that grab the disc. Sometimes, these cannot handle non-standard disc sizes. A drive may feature audio play and volume controls and a headphone jack.\n\nNote: Drives also feature a small hole that accesses a disc eject mechanism (insert a paper clip to activate the mechanism). This is useful if the standard eject button will not work or if the drive does not have power.\n\nA DVD drive is similar to a CD drive, but with a different encoding method and a shorter wavelength laser. DVD drives also feature a higher transfer rate, with multiples of 1.32 MBps (equivalent to 9x CD speed). The fastest models feature 24x read and write speeds.\n\nNote: Most DVD drives can read and burn both DVD and CD media. When DVD was first introduced, drives that could burn CDs but only read DVDs were referred to as combo drives.\n\nGenerally speaking, Blu-ray drives are also capable of CD and DVD playback and burning. Recordable (BD-R) and re-recordable (BD-RE) drives and discs are also available. BD-R is often available at the same speed as playback while BD-RE is usually half playback speed.\ntag: C1 L3 TC FIGURE

FLASH MEMORY DEVICES\n\nSolid state storage is any type of persistent digital storage technology that does not use mechanical parts. Most solid state devices used with modern PCs are based on flash memory. Flash memory is a type of non-volatile Electrically Erasable Programmable Read-Only Memory (EEPROM), also referred to as NAND flash. Flash memory is non-volatile because it does not need a power source to retain information.\n\nCompared to other types of storage, flash memory is very small and light. Mass manufacturing has seen prices fall to affordable levels. Storage capacity ranges from 512 MB to 256 GB. Larger drives than this are available but (at the time of writing) are prohibitively expensive.\n\nAs the costs of producing flash memory have fallen, it has become a very popular removable storage technology.\n\n(https://4sorcero.s3.amazonaws.com/byteback/core_1/fig_core_1_145.png)\nUSB thumb drive (left) and Sd memory card (right). (Image © 123RF.com.)\n\nThere are many ways of packaging flash memory for external storage use. One of the most popular is the USB drive (or thumb or pen drive). This type of drive simply plugs into any spare USB port.\n\nAnother popular type of packaging is the memory card, used extensively in consumer digital imaging products, such as digital still and video cameras. There are several proprietary types of memory card.\n• Secure Digital (SD)—this full-size card comes in three capacity variants. The original SD cards have a 2 GB maximum capacity, whereas SDHC is up to 32 GB and SDXC is up to 2 TB. There are also four speed variants. The original specification is up to 25 MBps, UHS allows up to 108 MBps, UHS-II is rated at up to 156 MBps full duplex or 312 MBps half duplex, while UHS-III specifies two full duplex rates of 312 MBps (FD312) and 624 MBps (FD624).\n• Mini-SD—this is a smaller version of the SD card, using the same capacity and speed designations.\n• Micro-SD—this is the smallest version of the SD card, using the same capacity and speed designations.\n• Compact Flash (CF)—nominally supports 512 GB, though no cards larger than 256 GB were ever made. The speed of CF cards is rated on the same system as CDs, using multiples of 150 KBps. The fastest devices work at up to 1066x read speeds (or 160 MBps).\n• xD—this format was used on Olympus cameras but has been discontinued.\n\nNote: The speeds quoted are "max burst speed." Sustained read and write speeds will be much lower. Cards also have a speed class rating indicating their minimum write speed capability.\n\nNote: The smaller form factors can be used with regular size readers using a caddy to hold the card.\ntag: C1 L3 TC FIGURE

MEMORY CARD READERS\nMany PCs are fitted with memory card readers with slots that will accommodate most of the sticks on the market.\n\nA memory card reader is usually designed to fit in a front-facing 3.5" drive bay, though some can be fitted to a 5.25" bay.\n\n(https://4sorcero.s3.amazonaws.com/byteback/core_1/fig_core_1_146a.png)\nMemory card reader. (Image © 123RF.com.)\n\nThe reader then needs to be connected to a USB hub. Most motherboards have at least one spare 9-pin USB header for making internal connections, or the reader may come with an expansion card (as with the HP model shown below). Alternatively, you may be able to run a USB converter cable from the reader to one of the external USB ports.\n\nNote: To support the fast speeds of modern card types, the reader must be connected to a USB 3 port.\n\nAnother option is an external USB memory card reader.\ntag: C1 L3 TC FIGURE

EXTERNAL STORAGE DRIVES\nExternal hard disks and portable SSDs have become very popular for backup, additional storage, and as a means of transferring files. External drives are packaged in a drive enclosure. The drive enclosure usually provides USB, Thunderbolt, and/or eSATAp ports. The enclosure also provides for an external power supply, if the drive is too large to be powered over USB, and the casing protects the drive from damage.\n\n(https://4sorcero.s3.amazonaws.com/byteback/core_1/fig_core_1_146b.png)\nExternal storage device.

Advanced enclosures are designed to host multiple disk units, possibly configured in a RAID array to provide better data security.\ntag: C1 L3 TC FIGURE

Topic D\nConfigure RAID\n\nEXAM OBJECTIVES COVERED\n1001-3.4 Given a scenario, select, install and configure storage devices.\n\nWhether it is the system files required to run the OS or data files generated by users, an HDD or SSD stores critical data. If a boot drive fails, the system will crash, and if a data drive fails, users will lose access to files and there may be permanent data loss if those files have not been backed up. To mitigate these risks, the drives that underpin critical systems can be provisioned in a redundant configuration. Redundancy sacrifices some disk capacity but provides fault tolerance for the mission-critical volume. As a PC technician, you will have to configure and support such systems very often, so it is important that you understand the types of redundant drive configurations available.\ntag: C1 L3 TD

RAID\nWith Redundant Array of Independent Disks (RAID), many hard disks can act as backups for each other to increase reliability and fault tolerance, or they can act together as one very large drive.\n\nNote: RAID can also be said to stand for "Redundant Array of Inexpensive Disks" and the D" can also stand for "devices."\ntag: C1 L3 TD

RAID LEVELS\nThe RAID advisory board defines RAID levels. The most common levels are numbered from 0 to 6, where each level corresponds to a specific type of fault tolerance. Only levels 0, 1, and 5 are of much relevance at the desktop, however.\n• RAID 0 (Striping without Parity). Disk striping is a technique where data is divided into blocks and spread in a fixed order among all the disks in the array. RAID 0 requires at least two disks. Its principal advantage is to improve performance by spreading disk I/O over multiple drives.\n\nThe logical volume size is the combined total of the smallest capacity physical disk in the array. When building a RAID array, all the disks should normally be identical in terms of capacity and ideally in terms of type and performance, though this is not mandatory. If disks are different sizes, the size of the smallest disk in the array determines the maximum amount of space that can be used on the larger drives.\n\nRAID 0 adds no storage overhead and is a means of obtaining a large logical volume from multiple, low capacity disks. However, because it provides no redundancy, this method cannot be said to be a true RAID implementation. If any physical disk in the array fails, the whole logical volume will fail, causing the computer to crash and requiring data to be recovered from backup. Consequently, RAID 0 would never be used for live data storage.\n\n(https://4sorcero.s3.amazonaws.com/byteback/core_1/fig_core_1_150.png)\nRAID 0 (striping) - data is spread across the array. (Image © 123RF.com.)\n\n•  RAID 1 (Mirroring). Mirroring requires two hard disks. The mirror disk is a duplicate of the data disk. Each write operation is duplicated on the second disk in the set, introducing a small performance overhead. A read operation can use either disk, boosting performance somewhat.\n\nThis strategy is the simplest way of protecting a single disk against failure. If one disk fails (degrading the array), the other takes over. There is little impact on performance during this time (obviously the boost of having two drives available for read operations is lost), so availability remains good, but the failed disk should be replaced as quickly as possible as there is no longer any redundancy. When the disk is replaced, it must be populated with data from the other disk (resynching). Performance while rebuilding is reduced, though RAID 1 is better than other levels in that respect and the rebuilding process is generally shorter than parity-based RAID.\n\nIn terms of cost per gigabyte, disk mirroring is more expensive than other forms of fault tolerance because disk space utilization is only 50 percent. Also the total volume size cannot exceed the available capacity of the physical disks. However, disk mirroring usually has a lower entry cost because it requires only two disks and a relatively cheap RAID controller (or software RAID). The availability of cheap, large HDDs makes the 50% overhead less of a drawback.\n\n(https://4sorcero.s3.amazonaws.com/byteback/core_1/fig_core_1_151.png)\nRAID 1 (mirroring) - data is written to both disks simultaneously. (Image © 123RF.com.)\n\n• RAID 5 (Striping with Distributed Parity) Striping with distributed parity (RAID 5) writes error checking information across all the disks in the array. The data and parity information is managed so that the two are always on different disks. If a single disk fails, enough information is spread across the remaining disks to allow the data to be completely reconstructed. Stripe sets with parity offer the best performance for read operations. However, when a disk has failed, the read performance is degraded by the need to recover the data using the parity information. Also, all normal write operations suffer reduced performance due to the parity calculation.\n\nRAID 5 requires a minimum of three drives but can be configured with more. This allows more flexibility in determining the overall capacity of the array than is possible with RAID 1. A "hard" maximum number of devices is set by the controller or OS support, but the number of drives used is more likely to be determined by practicalities such as cost and risk. Remember that adding more disks increases the chance of failure. The level of fault tolerance and available disk space is inverse. As you add disks to the set, fault tolerance decreases but usable disk space increases. If you configure a RAID 5 set using 3 disks, a third of each disk is set aside for parity. If four are used, one quarter is reserved on each disk. Using a three 80 GB disk configuration, you would have a 160 GB usable volume.\n\n(https://4sorcero.s3.amazonaws.com/byteback/core_1/fig_core_1_152a.png)\nRAID 5 (striping with parity). (Image © 123RF.com.)\n\nNote: If the disks are different sizes, the size used is that of the smallest disk. Extra disk space on larger drives is wasted.\n\n• RAID 1+0 (RAID 10) As described previously, RAID 0 is striping with no parity (that is, no fault tolerance is provided). This provides high throughput, but leaves the volume at risk. RAID 1 provides mirroring; the highest achievable disk fault tolerance. RAID 1+0 (also called RAID 10) is a combination of both these configurations (nested RAID). A logical striped volume is configured with two mirrored arrays. This configuration offers excellent fault tolerance as one disk in each mirror can fail and the array will still function.\n\nYou will need at least four disks to create this configuration and there must be an even number of disks. Note that it carries the same 50% disk overhead that mirroring does.\n\n(https://4sorcero.s3.amazonaws.com/byteback/core_1/fig_core_1_152b.png)\nRAID 10 - either disk in each of the sub-volumes can fail without bringing down the mail volume.

RAID CONFIGURATION OPTIONS\nIt is possible to implement RAID using either hardware or software.\n\nHARDWARE RAID\nA hardware RAID solution means that creating volumes from an array of physical disks is an operation supported by a plug-in controller card or by the motherboard, independently of the installed operating system. Hardware solutions are principally differentiated by their support for RAID levels. Entry-level controllers might support only RAID 0 or RAID 1, whereas mid-level controllers might add support for RAID 5 and RAID 10.\n\nIn addition, hardware RAID is often able to hot swap a damaged disk (replace the failed unit without shutting down Windows), thereby keeping the system operational all the time. Hot swapping is a feature of high-end hardware RAID solutions and requires a compatible controller and disk units. When the new disk is installed, the RAID controller transparently synchronizes it with the remaining disks in the set.\n\nOn the downside, hardware RAID is more expensive than a software solution and may lock you into a single vendor solution.\n\nModern low cost RAID solutions may use the SATA interface whereas Serial Attached SCSI (SAS) is a popular technology for server-class machines.\n\nThe array is normally configured by launching the firmware configuration utility by pressing the appropriate key combination during startup. Sometimes a RAID controller configuration tool is available from within the OS, too.\n\n(https://4sorcero.s3.amazonaws.com/byteback/core_1/fig_core_1_153.png)\nConfiguring a volume using RAID controller firmware.\n\nSOFTWARE RAID\nWindows provides the option to set up software-based RAID using standard disks and controllers. Windows Server and Windows client Professional/Enterprise editions support fault tolerant mirroring (RAID 1) and striping with parity (RAID 5) arrays. In a software solution, internal disks using different types of interface can be combined in an array but USB- or Thunderbolt-connected external drives are usually not supported. All editions of Windows 10, however, come with the Storage Spaces feature, which provides mirroring and parity-based RAID-like functionality with USB-connected and other external drive types. Linux  can use the Logical Volume Manager (LVM) to implement most RAID levels.\n\nHOT SWAP\nA system configured for RAID might support hot swappable drives. While this is usually a server-level feature, it might be implemented on high-end workstations. Rather than using cabled connectors, hot swappable drives plug (or "mate") into a combined data and power port on the enclosure. This means that drives can be easily added and removed from the front of the case without having to open the chassis. The drives are secured and released from the enclosure using a latch.\n\n(https://4sorcero.s3.amazonaws.com/byteback/core_1/fig_core_1_154.png)\nMedia server with hot swappable hard drives.

If you have a computer with three hard disks, what type of RAID fault-tolerant configuration will make best use of them?\n\nAnswer 1. RAID 5 (striping with parity); RAID 0 is not fault-tolerant and RAID 1 and RAID 10 require an even number of disks.\n\nQuestion 2. You are configuring four 120 GB drives in a RAID 5 array.

Topic E\nTroubleshoot Storage Devices\n\nEXAM OBJECTIVES COVERED\n1001-5.3 Given a scenario, troubleshoot hard drives and RAID arrays.\n\nEnd users rely on the hard drives in their PCs to store important system information and personal or professional data and files. Without a hard drive that works properly, the computer system is essentially worthless. As a CompTIA A+ technician, you will likely be called upon to fix or troubleshoot common problems with hard drives and other storage devices.\ntag: C1 L3 TE

DISK FAILURES\n\nHard disk drives are most likely to fail due to mechanical problems either in the first few months of operation or after a few years, when they begin to reach the end of their useful life. Sudden loss of power can also damage a disk, especially if it is in the middle of a read/write operation.\n\nA hard drive that is failing might display the following symptoms:\n•  When you are trying to open or save a file, an error message such as "Cannot read from the source disk" is displayed. Blue Screen of Death (BSoD)\n•  A failing hard disk and file corruption may cause a particularly severe read/write failure, resulting in system STOP errors (a crash screen).\n•  When you run the chkdsk /r program it can test the surface of the hard disk. If more bad sectors are located each time the test is run, it is a sure sign that the disk is about to fail.\n\nNote: Use the Check Disk utility regularly to check that the drive is in good condition. chkdsk /f will fix file system errors but will not identify bad sectors.\n\n• Constant LED activity. Disk thrashing can be a sign that there is not enough system RAM as data is continually moved between RAM and the pagefile.\n• Noise. A healthy hard disk makes a certain low-level noise when accessing the platters. A loud or grinding noise or any sort of clicking is a sign of a problem.\n\nWhen experiencing any of these symptoms, replace the disk as soon as possible to\nminimize the risk of data loss.\ntag: C1 L3 TD

DISK INTEGRITY TESTING\nYou can use the Windows chkdsk utility to verify the integrity of a formatted disk. Most hard drives run a self-diagnostic program called S.M.A.R.T (Self-Monitoring, Analysis and Reporting Technology) that can alert the operating system if reliability is compromised. In Windows, you can run the following command to perform a S.M.A.R.T check:\n\nwmic /node:localhost diskdrive get status\n\nIf you suspect that a drive is failing, you should try to run more advanced diagnostic tests on the drive. Most hard drive vendors supply utilities for testing drives or there may be a system diagnostics program supplied with the computer system.\n\n(https://4sorcero.s3.amazonaws.com/byteback/core_1/fig_core_1_157a.png)\nUsing system diagnostics software to test a hard drive.\n\nYou can also use Windows utilities to query S.M.A.R.T. and run manual tests.\n\n(https://4sorcero.s3.amazonaws.com/byteback/core_1/fig_core_1_157b.png)\nViewing S.M.A.R.T. information via the SpeedFan utility.\ntag: C1 L3 TE FIGURE

BOOT FAILURES\nIf the hard drive is not detected at boot (or if a second hard drive is not shown under Windows), first check that it is powering up. Drive activity is usually indicated by an LED on the front panel of the system unit case. If this is inactive, check that the drive has a power connector attached. If the PC has no LEDs, or you suspect that they may be faulty, it is usually possible to hear the hard drive spinning up. Once you have determined that the drive is powering up, try the following:\n• If the system is not booting correctly from the hard drive, check that the boot sequence is set correctly in the PC firmware system setup program and that there are no removable disks in floppy or optical drives.\n• Check that data cables are not damaged and that they are correctly connected to the drive.\n• If the drives are connected to a motherboard port, check that it has not been disabled by a jumper or via system setup.\n\nOnce you have determined that the drive configuration is correct, try the following. If a boot hard drive is detected by the firmware hardware check (Power On Self-Test POST])  but not by Windows (for example, if you get an error such as "OS not found"), there is probably a problem with the file system. Boot into the recovery environment using the Windows setup disc and enter C: at the command prompt. If this produces the error message Invalid media type, the disk has no valid file system structure on it. This may be caused by surface errors or by a virus. You may be able to recover from this by running the bootrec tool at a boot command prompt or by reformatting the disk (at the expense of any data, of course).\n\nIf you enter C: at the command prompt and you see the error message Invalid drive specification, the drive may have an invalid partition structure. You can check the drive's partition structure with diskpart.\ntag: C1 L3 TE FIGURE

BOOT BLOCK REPAIR\nOne of the unwelcome actions that malware can perform is to damage the boot information on the hard drive. There are two ways of formatting the boot information:\n\nMBR and GPT.\n• In the Master Boot Record (MBR) scheme, the MBR is located in the first sector of the first partition. It contains information about the partitions on the disk plus some code that points to the location of the active boot sector. The Boot Sector is located either on the sector after the MBR or the first sector of each other partition. It describes the partition file system and contains the code that points to the method of booting the OS (the Boot Configuration Data store for a Windows system, or GRUB or LILO Linux boot managers). Each primary partition can contain a boot sector, but only one of them can be marked active.\n• With the Globally Unique ID (GUID) Partition Table (GPT) boot scheme, the boot information is not restricted to a single sector, but still serves the same basic purpose of identifying partitions and boot loaders. GPT is associated with UEFI firmware, but can also be used by most legacy BIOS firmware if supported by the OS (32-bit Windows has problems booting from a combination of GPT and BIOS). GPT is not subject to the restrictions on number and size of partitions that limit MBR; there are still limits, but not ones that are likely to be reached in practice.\n\nNote: GPT often uses a "protective" MBR to prevent disk tools from overwriting the GPT.\n\nWhether the disk is using an MBR or GPT partitioning scheme, damage to these records results in boot errors such as "OS not found" or "Invalid drive specification." If this problem has been caused by a virus (it can also occur due to disk corruption or installing operating systems with conflicting boot loaders in multiboot configurations), the best way to resolve it is to use the boot disk option in your antivirus software. This will include a basic antivirus scanner that may detect the virus that caused the problem in the first place.\n\nIf you don't have the option of using a recovery disk created by the antivirus software, you can try to use the repair options that come with the Windows product disk. Be aware that these may not work completely reliably if the system is still infected with a virus.\n\n1. Boot from the product disk and select the Repair option.\n2. First, try to use the Startup Repair option. If this does not work, select the Command Prompt option.\n• Enter bootrec /fixmbr to attempt repair of the MBR.\n• Enter bootrec /fixboot to attempt repair of the boot sector.\n• Enter bootrec /rebuildbcd to add missing Windows installations to the Boot Configuration Database (BCD).\n3.Restart the PC.\n\nNote: These tools may not be suitable for use with multiboot configurations if one of the other OSes has created a non-standard partition table.\ntag: C1 L3 TE

FILE RECOVERY OPTIONS\nIf the computer will not boot from a hard disk, you may want to try to recover data from it. To do this, you will usually need to remove the drive from its internal enclosure and connect it to another PC. Use a driver that matches the type (flat, crosshead/ crosspoint/Phillips, or star/Torx) and size of screw to avoid damaging the screw heads or threads.\n\nExternal enclosure kits are available to provide the data and power connectors required. The enclosure will then generally be interfaced to the PC via a USB port and the disk can be mounted using Disk Management (if it is in a state to be recognized by Windows) or analyzed using file recovery software.\n\nIf a file is corrupted, it may be possible to use software to rebuild it (or at least, to recover some data from it). chkdsk restores file fragments from bad sectors to the root of the volume (as filennnn.chk files), but these are rarely directly usable. Third-party file recovery software is available and can be more successful.\n\n(https://4sorcero.s3.amazonaws.com/byteback/core_1/fig_core_1_160.png)\nUsing file recovery software to scan a disk.\ntag: C1 L3 TE FIGURE

DISK PERFORMANCE ISSUES\nSlow disk performance is often a bottleneck for modern computer systems. In this case, the best solution may be to add more RAM rather than replace the disk or to upgrade the disk to an SSD or hybrid drive.\n\nDisk performance can be improved by ensuring that file fragmentation is minimized. Disk defragmentation is a process whereby the contents of a disk are moved around to optimize disk access times. The components of a file (known as clusters) are placed adjacent on the disk surface (they are said to be contiguous). Windows normally tries to run the defragmenter periodically as a scheduled task, but this process can be interrupted by user file access requests. It may be necessary to run the tool manually during a "downtime" period.\n\nLow disk capacity can also be a cause of slow performance. When a disk is 90% full, its capacity meter is shown in red in Explorer. Windows warns the user via the notification area when disk space is critically low (below 200 MB). If the disk continues to be filled up, system performance will be very severely impacted. You can use the Disk Cleanup program to free up space, but the user may have to take manual steps, such as moving or deleting files, uninstalling unnecessary applications, and so on.\ntag: C1 L3 TE

GUIDELINES FOR TROUBLESHOOTING OPTICAL DRIVES\nConsider these guidelines when troubleshooting optical drives.\n\nGENERAL TROUBLESHOOTING TIPS FOR OPTICAL DRIVES\nHere are some general guidelines for troubleshooting optical drives:\n• Optical drives such as CD, DVD, and Blu-ray drives can generally go for a very long time between failures. This is because the part of the drive that reads the disc does not actually touch the disc. All reading (and writing with recordable and re-writable media) is done using lasers. This means that the read/write "heads" are not as likely to get dirty as with magnetic media drives such as floppy drives, where the read/ write heads commonly touch the disc. However, discs do get dirty and carry that dirt inside the optical drive. Special cleaning kits are available for cleaning optical drives if read/write problems are experienced. Most problems related to dirt, though, are caused by dirt on the disc itself.\n• Support for CD drives is built into Windows. If your CD drive is not able to read CDs at all, it is likely to be a hardware problem.\n• DVD-Video requires MPEG decoding hardware or software (codecs) to be installed for playback. This is supplied with Vista Home Premium and Ultimate editions and in each edition of Windows 7 except Starter and Home Basic. Windows 8 requires third-party software to be installed. Remember also that a DVD-ROM cannot be read from a CD-ROM drive.\n• There is currently no native support for Blu-ray in any version of Windows, but the drive should be bundled with the appropriate codecs and software.\ntag: C1 L3 TE

TROUBLESHOOTING CD/DVD/BD WRITING\nHere are some guidelines for troubleshooting write errors on optical discs:\n• Where Windows does not support a particular recordable or rewritable format directly, third-party software is required.\n• Some writable media are not manufactured to the highest possible standards, so errors during CD or DVD write operations can be quite common. Check that you are using the write speed recommended for the brand of discs you have purchased. If the error is persistent, however, it is not due to the media.\n• Most problems are connected to buffer underruns. On older devices, once the writing process starts, it cannot be paused. Therefore, if the OS does not supply data to the burner's buffer quickly enough, errors will be introduced into the disc's layout. The following solutions can usually be applied:\n• Try burning discs at a lower write speed.\n• Copy source files to the local hard disk (rather than removable or network drives).\n• Do not use other applications when burning a disc.\n• The latest CD and DVD writers usually ship with buffer underrun protection.\ntag: C1 L3 TE

COMMON RAID CONFIGURATION ISSUES\nRAID is usually a means of protecting data against the risk of a hard disk drive failing. The data is either copied to a second drive (mirroring) or additional information is recorded on multiple drives to enable them to recover from a device failure (parity).\n\nRAID can be implemented using hardware controllers or features of the operating system.

GUIDELINES FOR TROUBLESHOOTING RAID ISSUES\nHere are some guidelines to consider when you are troubleshooting RAID issues.\n\nTROUBLESHOOT RAID ISSUES\nConsider these guidelines as you troubleshoot RAID issues:\n• If Windows does not detect a RAID array during setup or at boot time:\n• Check that the drivers for the RAID controller are installed and use the RAID configuration utility to verify its status.\n\n(https://4sorcero.s3.amazonaws.com/byteback/core_1/fig_core_1_162.png)\nBoot message indicating a problem with the RAID volume—press Ctrl+C to start the utility and troubleshoot.\n\n• If you cannot access the configuration utility, then the controller itself could have failed.\n• If RAID stops working:\n• One of the purposes of using RAID (or at least RAID 1/5/10) is that it is much less likely than a simple disk system to just "stop working." If one of the underlying disks fails, the volume will be listed as "degraded," but the data on the volume will still be accessible.\n\nNote: RAID 0 has no redundancy, so if one of the disks fails, it will stop working. In this scenario, you had better hope that you have a recent data backup.\n\n• The precise process for managing a disk failure with an array will be dependent on the vendor that supplied the array and the configuration being supported. All array controllers will be capable of generating an event to the OS system log and perhaps of generating an alert message for the administrator.\n\n(https://4sorcero.s3.amazonaws.com/byteback/core_1/fig_core_1_163.png)\nRAID errors using the configuration utility - this volume is missing one of its disks.\n\n• Most desktop-level RAID solutions can tolerate the loss of only one disk, so it should be replaced as soon as possible. If the array supports hot swapping, then the new disk can simply be inserted into the chassis of the computer or disk chassis. Once this is done, the array can be rebuilt using the RAID configuration utility (if a hardware RAID controller is used) or Disk Management (if you are using dynamic disks to implement "software" RAID). Note that the rebuilding process is likely to severely affect performance as the controller is likely to be writing multiple gigabytes of data to the new disk.\n\nNote: When hot swapping a faulty disk out, take extreme caution not to remove a healthy disk from the array as making a mistake could cause the array to fail, depending on the configuration. Disk failure is normally indicated by a red LED. Always make a backup beforehand.\n\n• If a volume is not available, either more than the tolerated number of disks has failed or the controller has failed. If the boot volume is affected, then the operating system will not start. If too many disks have failed, you will have to turn to the latest backup or try to use file recovery solutions. If the issue is controller failure, then data on the volume should be recoverable, though there may be file corruption if a write operation was interrupted by the failure. Either install a new controller or import the disks into another system.\ntag: C1 L3 TE FIGURE

Activity 3-7\nDiscussing Storage Device Troubleshooting\n\nSCENARIO\nAnswer the following questions to check your understanding of the topic.\n\nQuestion 1. A user complains that a "Buffer underrun" error keeps occurring when they try to write to recordable DVDs. What would you suggest?\n\nAnswer 1. Do not use other applications at the same time as DVD writing, make sure that the source files are on the local hard disk (not a removable or network drive), or try using a slower write speed.\n\nQuestion 2. You are trying to install Windows from the setup disc, but the computer will not boot from the CD. What should you do?\n\nAnswer 2. Check the boot order in system setup is set correctly; check that the disc is not dirty or scratched.\n\nQusetion 3. If you experience an error such as “BCD missing" when booting the computer, what action could you take?\n\nAnswer 3. Use the Startup Repair tool or run bootrec /rebuildbcd.\n\nQuestion 4. A user reports hearing noises from the hard disk—does this indicate it is failing and should be replaced?\n\nAnswer 4. Not necessarily—hard disks do make noises but they are not all indicators of a problem. Question the user to find out what sort of noises are occurring or inspect the system yourself.\n\nQuestion 5. A PC displays the message "Invalid media type" when you try to access it from a command prompt. What is the likely cause and how might you attempt to fix it?\n\nAnswer 5. The file system is corrupt. You can try using the Startup Repair tool or run bootrec /fixboot to recover it without losing data.\n\nQuestion 6. A user reports that there is a loud clicking noise when she tries to save a file. What should be your first troubleshooting step?\n\nAnswer 6. Determine whether a data backup has been made. If not, try to make one.\n\nQuestion 7. You are investigating a disk problem. The system can no longer access the C: drive. What command could you use to try to repair the error?\n\nAnswer 7. bootrec /fixmbr\n\nQuestion 8. A RAID utility reports that the volume is degraded. What should you do?\n\nAnswer 8. A degraded volume is still working but has lost one of its disks. In most RAID configurations, another disk failure would cause the volume to fail so you should add a new disk as soon as possible (though do note that rebuilding the array will reduce performance).\ntag: C1 L3 TE A3-7

Activity 3-8\nTroubleshooting Storage Devices\n\nBEFORE YOU BEGIN\nActivity: To simulate the first issue, your instructor will introduce a drive problem on your system.\n\nSCENARIO\nIn this activity, you will troubleshoot different issues relating to hard drives.\n\nQuestion 1. A user has reported that her computer cannot boot and is getting an error message at POST. Diagnose and correct the issue.\na) Reproduce the problem by booting the computer and observing the error. Listen to determine if the drive is spinning up during POST.\nb) Access the firmware setup program to check that the drive port is enabled.\nc) Power off the computer, disconnect any cabling, and then open the case. Verify that the drive data cable and power cable are properly connected.\nd) If nothing else corrects the problem, replace the drive.\n\nQuestion 2. Another user has reported that there are grinding noises coming from her computer case. Once you take a closer look, you suspect that it is the hard drive.\n\nWhat is the possible cause and solution to this type of issue?\n\nAnswer 2.\nThe hard drive is physically damaged, so the drive must be replaced.\nA virus has attacked the hard drive, so you can use antivirus software to mitigate the issues.\nData is corrupt on the drive, and the PC has not been shut down correctly.\n\nQuestion 3. When a user tries to access the hard drive containing his data, the system locks up and makes a clicking sound. From the command prompt, he can change to drive D , but when he tries to access a file or list the files on the drive, it locks up and begins clicking again.\nWhat is the most likely cause of the problem?\n\nAnswer 3. The most likely cause of this problem is a bad hard drive—some of the sectors on the hard drive are probably damaged. You will probably need to replace the hard drive. If you do continue to use the drive, monitor it closely and ensure that the user backs up file data often.\n\nQuestion 4. What steps might you take to attempt to resolve this problem?\n\nAnswer 4. You could try running the Windows error-checking option in the Tools pane of the Local Disk Properties dialog box. Definitely back up the data if you can get to any of it. You can try using other software utilities to recover the data or take the drive to a data recovery facility.\n\nQuestion 5. A user reports that some of his folders have begun disappearing and some folder and file names are scrambled with strange characters in their names. What is the most likely cause of the problem?\n\nAnswer 5. If it is not caused by a virus, the most likely cause of this problem is a bad hard drive, and you will probably need to replace it. If you do continue to use the drive, monitor it closely and ensure that the user backs up file data often.\n\nQuestion 6. What steps might you take to attempt to resolve this problem?\n\nAnswer 6. You should isolate the system or drive and check for viruses, because the result of some infections looks like this problem. If you do not identify a security issue, use error checking tools, such as Windows chkdsk, to scan the file system. Back up the data if you can get to any of it. You can try using other software utilities to recover the data or take the drive to a data recovery facility.\ntag: C1 L3 TE A3-8
