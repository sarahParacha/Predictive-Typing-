Topic A\nInstall and Configure Display Devices\ntag: C1 L2 TA

EXAM OBJECTIVES COVERED\n1001-3.1 Explain basic cable types, features, and their purposes.\n1001-3.5 Given a scenario, install and configure motherboards, CPUs, and add-on cards.\n1001-3.6 Explain the purposes and uses of various peripheral types.\nOutput devices are those that transmit information from the computer system to the user, whether as video/graphics (display), audio (speakers), or hard copy (printer). The video subsystem is the main type of output provided with a PC. Graphics output is provided by some sort of display unit or monitor plus a video card, which generates the signals to drive the monitor.\ntag: C1 L2 TA

DISPLAY DEVICE TYPES\nDisplay devices include monitors, projectors, and VR headsets. You will work most often with monitors, as they are required by practically every desktop and portable computer.\n\nSome notable manufacturers of display devices include ViewSonic , Iiyama, Sony, Panasonic, Toshiba, LG, Acer , Sanyo, and Mitsubishi.\ntag: C1 L2 TA

MONITORS\nHistorically, computer monitors used the same sort of cathode ray tube (CRT) technology as consumer television sets. A CRT requires an analog signal from the display adapter to form the picture. CRTs are also very bulky. In the last decade or so, flat panel displays have replaced CRTs. Flat panels use digital signaling, are much thinner and lighter, and use less power than CRTs.\ntag: C1 L2 TA

LCDs\nFlat panel Liquid Crystal Displays are the standard display type for PC systems and laptops. Liquid crystals are chemicals whose properties change with the application of voltage. In modern types of LCD, voltages "twist" the molecules in the liquid crystal to block the passage of light to some degree to set the pixel to the required color.\n\nEach picture element (pixel) in a color LCD comprises cells (or subpixels) with filters to generate the three primary colors (red, green, and blue). Each pixel is addressed by a transistor to vary the intensity of each cell, therefore creating the gamut (range of colors) that the display can generate. In the types of flat panel used for computer displays, the liquid crystal elements and transistors are placed on a Transistor (TFT) and such LCD panels are often just referred to as "TFTs." TFTs designed for use with PCs are usually of two types:\n• Twisted Nematic (TN)—produces acceptable results and good response times. Low response times make the display prone to motion blur and "trails."\n• In-Plane Switching (IPS)—the different arrangement of the cells in IPS panels delivers better color reproduction at a wider range of viewing angles (especially vertical viewing angles) than TN-type displays. The trade-off is slightly worse response time\n\nTFTs are driven by a digital signal, but many older models come with analog-digital converters so they can accept an analog signal from an interface such as Video Graphics Array (VGA).\n\n(https://4sorcero.s3.amazonaws.com/byteback/core_1/fig_core_1_77.png)\ntag: C1 L2 TA FIGURE

LCD BACKLIGHTS\nA TFT panel must be illuminated to produce a clear image. In cheaper displays, the backlight is a Cold Cathode Fluorescent (CCFL) bulb. In most modern TFTs, the backlight is provided by an array of Light Emitting Diodes (LED) rather than a fluorescent bulb. There are a number of different types of LED lighting:\n• Edge lit—the LEDs are arranged around the screen rather than behind it. A diffuser is used to try to make the light evenly bright across the whole of the screen.\n• Backlit—the LEDs are positioned in an array behind the TFT. This should illuminate the panel more evenly. The disadvantage is that the panel will be slightly thicker. A full array LED backlight can also allow for local dimming, where the LEDs can be selectively dimmed in zones, improving contrast ratio (and power efficiency).\n• Color temperature—the backlight can either generate a uniform white light (WLED) or be composed of some combination of RGB or GB LEDs, to allow for different color "temperatures."\ntag: C1 L2 TA

OLED DISPLAYS\nAn OLED (Organic LED) display is a newer type of device, often used for small screens (in smartphones, for instance), though more full-scale OLED monitors are starting to appear. One advantage of OLED is that it does not require a separate backlight, making the representation of "True Black" much better and allowing the display to be thinner, lighter, and consume less power. Also, OLEDs can be made from plastic with no requirement for a layer of glass. This means that the display can be curved to different shapes. Manufacturers are even experimenting with flexible, roll-up displays.\ntag: C1 L2 TA

DIGITAL PROJECTORS\nA video projector is a large format display, suitable for use in a presentation or at a meeting. The image is projected onto a screen or wall using a lens system. Some types of projectors are portable; others are fixed in place.\n\n(https://4sorcero.s3.amazonaws.com/byteback/core_1/fig_core_1_78.png)\nA DLP projector (Image © 123RF.com.)\n\nLike display monitors, projectors can use different imaging technologies:\n• Cathode Ray Tube (CRT)—you may come across legacy projectors using this analog format, but they are not widely marketed anymore.\n• Liquid Crystal Display (LCD)—this is a similar technology to that used in display screens except that the lamp used to project the image is much more powerful than a backlight.\n\n• Digital Light Processing (DLP)—developed by Texas Instruments. Each pixel in a DLP device is represented by a mirror, which can be tilted towards or away from the lamp, and color filters to create the required shade.\n• Laser projector—a lampless projector still uses LCD or DLP imaging but replaces the bulb light source with laser light. Some systems use three lasers (red, green, and blue) while others use a single laser with splitters and phosphors to generate different shades.\n\nNote: Take care when handling projectors. During use, the bulb becomes very hot and while it is hot will be very fragile. Allow a projector to cool completely before attempting to move it.\ntag: C1 L2 TA FIGURE

VR HEADSETS\n\nA Virtual Reality (VR) headset is a device that fits over your eyes and ears. It aims to replace sights and sounds from the real world with images and noises generated by a computer application. The headset also comes with handheld controllers to allow you to move the avatar representing you in the virtual space and interact with the virtual environment.\n\nVR is mostly used for games but has other obvious applications for meetings and social networking that is likely to see it more widely adopted in business networks in the next few years. There are two main types of headsets: tethered VR headsets are self contained devices, whereas mobile VR headsets are designed to use a specific smartphone model (or range of models) to provide the display.\n\nTethered headsets, such as the HTC Vive  and Oculus Rift, require an HDMI port plus a number of USB ports on the host PC. While not current at the time of writing, it is likely that most systems will adopt a single USB-C cable in the near future. Tethered VR headsets have substantial system requirements for the CPU, graphics adapter, and system memory.\n\nNote: Make sure the surrounding area is free from obstructions and trip hazards so that the wearer is less likely to hurt themselves or damage anything in the nearby environment.\ntag: C1 L2 TA

DISPLAY DEVICE SETTINGS AND FEATURES\nDisplay devices are evaluated on the following characteristics:\n\n• Resolution and analog versus digital output.  Resolution is the number of Display Device Settings pixels(picture elements) used to create the image. Resolution is quoted as the number of horizontal and vertical pixels (for example, if the resolution is 640x480, the image is 640 pixels wide by 480 pixels high). Each pixel can be a different color. The total number of colors supported in the image is referred to as the color depth (or bit depth). Early (very early) computer monitors had limited color support, such as 8-bit (256 colors). Modern TFTs will support either 18-bit or 24-bit (or higher) color.\n\nA video card (the component that generates the screen image) can support a number of resolutions (limited by the card's bandwidth; higher resolutions require more data). If the resolution set is greater than the monitor's maximum resolution, then the display will be unstable or will not show anything. While analog display devices (such as legacy Cathode Ray Tube [CRT] monitors) can support a range of resolutions, digital display devices such as TFTs have a native resolution, based on the number of pixels in the display. An analog device such as CRT can support a number of output resolutions without losing quality (the crispness" of an image). TFTs only support lower resolutions by interpolating the image, which makes it look "fuzzy."\n\n• Screen size and aspect ratio  For flat panels, the quoted screen size is always the viewable area, measured diagonally. Most screens are around 20" but premium models are available up to 30." Aspect ratio is the width of the screen divided by the height. Flat panels are either 4:3 or widescreen (16:9 or 16:10), with widescreen models now dominating the market. One feature of some flat panels is the ability to pivot the display through 90 degrees (making it 3:4 or 9:16).\n\nNote: Consumer widescreen (for DVD movies) is 16:9, but many PC widescreen display formats are 16:10 to leave room for on-screen controls above or below the movie.\n\n• Refresh rate In an analog device, refresh rate is the speed at which the CRT redraws the image, measured in hertz (Hz). If the refresh rate is not high enough (below about 70 Hz), there will be a noticeable flicker as the image is redrawn. This can cause eyestrain and headache. TFTs are not refreshed in the same way and do not suffer from flicker, but the refresh rate in a TFT still has an impact on the quality of the image (in particular, how smoothly objects in motion are displayed).\n\nWhereas refresh rate is the number of times the display device updates the display (regardless of whether the image is changed or not), the frame rate is the number of times the image in a video stream changes per second. This can be expressed in Hertz or Frames per Second (fps). The refresh rate needs to be synched to the frame rate. For example, a display device with a 120 Hz refresh rate displays a 30 fps video stream at a ratio of 4:1. Standard TFTs have a refresh rate of 60 Hz with more expensive models featuring 120 or 240 Hz.\n\nResponse rate is the time taken for a pixel to change color, measured in milliseconds (ms). The best quality TFTs have a response rate of 8 ms or lower. High response rates (over 20 ms) can lead to "ghosting" or "trails" when the image changes quickly.\n\n\n• Brightness, contrast ratio, and illuminance. Luminance is the perceived brightness of a display screen, measured in candelas per square meter (cd/m²). Typically, TFTs are between 200 and 300 cd/m² though panels designed for home entertainment or gaming may be 500 cd/m² or better. Contrast ratio is a measure of luminance of white compared to black. Higher ratios (above 600:1) indicate that displays can display "true blacks" and better saturated (more intense) colors.\n\nWhen evaluating projectors, the critical performance factor is illuminance or light projecting power rather than luminance/brightness. With a flat panel, you want to evaluate how bright it appears when you look at it. With a projector, you want to evaluate the brightness of the image it projects onto another surface. Projectors are normally rated in lumens (or more specifically ANSI lumens, which represents a particular set of test conditions). A projector rated at around 3000 lumens will be able to display clear images with a small amount of ambient light (a room with the curtains closed and overhead lighting dimmed, for instance). A projector rated at 6000 lumens would be able to display a clear image in a sunlit room. Do note that the larger the image, the greater the projecting power needs to be to maintain the same image clarity.\n\n• Viewing angle and privacy filters  The image on a flat panel darkens and distorts to some degree if not viewed straight on. Although this is not an issue for desktop use, it can affect use of the screen for viewing movies or as a presentation device. Manufacturers may quote acceptable viewing angles in marketing literature, but these values are not usually comparable to one another. As mentioned above, IPS-type flat panels perform better at wide angles than TN-type panels. A privacy filter prevents anyone but the user from reading the screen. IPS-type TFTs are designed to be viewed from wide angles. This is fine for home entertainment use but raises the risk that someone would be able to observe confidential information shown on a user's monitor. A privacy filter restricts the viewing angle to the person directly in front of the screen.\n\n• Coatings. A display can come with either a matte or a gloss coating. A gloss coating helps the display to appear "richer" but also reflects more light, which can cause problems with screen glare and reflections of background objects. A may be superficially less impressive but is generally better suited to office work. Anti-glare covers are available if the ambient lighting causes problems with the display.\ntag: C1 L2 TA

VGA STANDARDS\nIBM  created Video Graphics Array (VGA) as a standard for the resolution and color depth of computer displays. VGA specifies a resolution of 640x480 with 16 colors (4-bit color) at 60 Hz. VGA also specifies other lower resolution modes with more colors, but 640x480 is what is commonly referred to as "VGA."\n\nIncreasing any one of resolution, color depth, or refresh rate increases the amount of bandwidth required for the video signal and the amount of processing that the CPU or Graphics Processing Unit (GPU) must do and the amount of system or graphics memory required.\n\nThe VGA standard is long obsolete but was further developed by the Video Electronics Standards Association (VESA) as Super VGA (SVGA). SVGA was originally 800x600 @ 4-bit or 8-bit color. This was very quickly extended as the capabilities of graphics cards and monitors increased with the de facto XGA standard providing 1024x768 resolution, better color depths, and higher refresh rates. Resolutions for modern display systems use some variant of the XGA "standard" (in fact, these are labels rather than standards) or a High Definition (HD) resolution, similar to that found on consumer electronics and media. Some of the more popular XGA and HD resolutions in use are as follows.\n\n(https://4sorcero.s3.amazonaws.com/byteback/core_1/table_core_1_80.png)\n(https://4sorcero.s3.amazonaws.com/byteback/core_1/table_core_1_81.png)\n\nStandard | Resolution | Aspect Ratio\nWXGA (Widescreen XGA) 1280x800 Widescreen (16:10)\nSXGA (Super XGA) 1280x1024 5:4\nHD 1366x768 Widescreen (16:9)\nWSXGA 1440x900 Widescreen (16:10)\nHD+ 1600x900 Widescreen (16:9)\nFull HD 1920x1080 Widescreen (16:9)\nQHD (Quad HD) 2560x1440 Widescreen (16:9)\n4K UHD (Ultra HD) 3840x2160 Widescreen (16:9)\ntag: C1 L2 TA TABLE

DISPLAY DEVICE CONNECTIONS AND CABLES\nThere are many different types of video connectors and cabling. An individual model of any one video card, monitor, or projector will often support more than one cable type. When computers were primarily used with CRT monitors, the graphics adapter would generate an analog video signal to drive the monitor. Now that most screens use TFT technology, the video signal is usually digital. Many digital monitors can take an incoming analog video signal but need to convert it back to digital (so the signal is being converted from digital to analog and then from analog back to digital).\ntag: C1 L2 TA

VGA PORTS AND CONNECTORS\n\nThe distinctive blue, 15-pin Video Graphics Array (VGA) port (HD15F/DE-15) was the standard analog video interface for PC devices for a very long time. Up until a few years ago, even new video cards and monitors usually included it, though it is starting to be phased out completely now.\n\nThe connector is a D-shell type (HD15M) with screws to secure it to the port. The screws very frequently become stuck or the housing bolt comes undone when you try to unscrew the connector.\n\n(https://4sorcero.s3.amazonaws.com/byteback/core_1/fig_core_1_81.png)\nA VGA connector and port. (Image © 123RF.com.)\n\nThe interface is analog, meaning that it carries a continuous, variable signal for Red, Green, and Blue (RGB) component video.\n\nBetter quality cables (generally speaking, the thicker the better) use shielded coaxial wiring and support longer lengths at better resolutions. Low quality cable may only be able to support 800x600. The cable may be marketed with the highest resolution it can support—UXGA (1600x1200), for instance. Most VGA cable does not exceed 5 m but a good quality cable might be able to support sub-HD resolutions at lengths of up to 30m.\ntag: C1 L2 TA FIGURE

DVI PORTS AND CONNECTORS\nDigital Visual Interface (DVI) is a video cable type designed for flat panel display equipment. While popular for a short period after its introduction in 1999, DVI is now being phased out in favor of better-established technologies, such as HDMI , DisplayPort™, and Thunderbolt™. You are unlikely to see DVI used on new display devices or computers.\n\nThere are five types of DVI, supporting different configurations for bandwidth and analog/digital signaling. The pin configuration of the connectors identifies what type of DVI is supported by a particular port.\n• DVI-A\n• DVI-D (single link)\n• DVI-I (single link)\n• DVI-D (dual link)\n• DVI-I (dual link)\n\n(https://4sorcero.s3.amazonaws.com/byteback/core_1/fig_core_1_82.png)\nDVI port and connector types. (Image © 123RF.com.)\n\nDVI-I supports both analog equipment (such as CRTs) and digital. DVI-A supports only analog equipment and DVI-D supports only digital.\n\nDVI bandwidth in single-link mode is 3.7 Gbps, enough for full HD resolution (1920x1200) at a frame rate of 60 fps. More bandwidth can be obtained through connectors that support dual-link mode. Dual-link supports over 7.4 Gbps, enough for HDTV @ 85 fps. A single-link connector can be plugged into a dual-link port, but not vice versa.\n\nThere are economy and premium brands of DVI cable. Cables have to support an HD signal at a length of at least 5 m (16.5 ft). Better quality cable will support longer lengths. The quality cable uses thicker wiring and better shielding.\ntag: C1 L2 TA FIGURE

HDMI PORTS AND CONNECTORS\n\nThe High Definition Multimedia Interface (HDMI) is the most widely used graphic device interface. It is ubiquitous on consumer electronics, such as televisions and Blu-HDMI Ports and ray players, as well as computer equipment. HDMI supports both video and audio digital streams, plus remote control (CEC) and digital content protection (HDCP).\n\nNote: HMDI carries only a digital signal. It does not support analog monitors.\n\nHDMI cabling is specified to different HDMI versions with different bandwidth capabilities. Notably, version 1.4 adds support for 4K (4096x2160@24Hz). 4K is the format used in digital cinemas and consequently represents something of a Holy Grail for home cinema enthusiasts. The Ultra HD (3840x2160) format is often also branded "4K."\n\nVersion 1.4 also allows the controller (typically a computer) and display device (an IP-capable TV, for instance) to establish a Fast Ethernet (100 Mbps) network link over an HDMI With Ethernet cable.\n\nAt the time of writing, HDMI is on version 2.1. This supports 48 Gbps bandwidth, or up to 10K at 120 Hz. HDMI uses a proprietary 19-pin (Type A) connector.\n\nThere is a Type B connector (29-pin) to support dual-link connections but it is not widely used.\n\n(https://4sorcero.s3.amazonaws.com/byteback/core_1/fig_core_1_83a.png)\nHDMI Type A port and connector. (Image © 123RF.com.)\n\n\nHDMI v1.3 introduced the Mini HDMI connector (Type C) for use on portable devices, such as camcorders. This is more compact but has the same number of pins. HDMI v1.4 also introduced the even smaller Micro HDMI connector (Type D), still with 19 pins.\n\n(https://4sorcero.s3.amazonaws.com/byteback/core_1/fig_core_1_83b.png)\nFrom left to right: HDMI connector and port, Mini-HDMI connector and port. (Image © 123RF.com.)\n\nHDMI cable is rated as either Standard (Category 1) or High Speed (Category 2). High Speed cable supports greater lengths and is required for v1.4 features, such as 4K and 3D. HDMI version 2.0 and 2.1 specify Premium High Speed (up to 18 Gbps) and Ultra High Speed (up to 48 Gbps) cable ratings.\n\nHDMI is backward-compatible with DVI-D using a suitable adapter cable. This means that (for example) a DVI-D graphics adapter could be connected to an HDMI port on the display device.\ntag: C1 L2 TA FIGURE

DISPLAYPORT PORTS AND CONNECTORS\nHDMI was principally developed by consumer electronics companies (Hitachi, Panasonic, Sony, and so on) and requires a royalty to use. DisplayPort was developed by the Video Electronics Standards Association (VESA), the organization largely representing PC graphics adapter and display technology companies. It is a royalty-free standard intended to complement HDMI.\n\nUnlike other video and audio standards, it transmits packetized data, in the same sort of way as PCI Express. Like PCI Express, bandwidth can be allocated in bonded lanes (up to 4). Each lane can be given a different data rate. In v1.2 of the standard, each lane Thunderbolt and USB-can be allocated a 1.62, 2.7, or 5.4 Gbps data rate. The maximum data rate for a 4-lane link is 17.28 Gbps. Like HDMI v1.4, there is support for 48-bit color, 3D, 4K/UHD, and HDCP. There is also an auxiliary channel that allows (for example) a microphone-enabled display to feed the audio signal back to the PC without additional cabling.\n\nDisplayPort supports both copper and fiber-optic cabling. DisplayPort-certified copper cable must be capable of supporting 2560x1600 (WQXGA resolution) over 2 m. It also supports multiple monitors "daisy-chained" on the same cable.\n\n(https://4sorcero.s3.amazonaws.com/byteback/core_1/fig_core_1_84.png)\nA DP++ DisplayPort port and connector. (Image © 123RF.com.)\n\nDisplayPort uses a 20-pin connector. A DP++ port allows a connection with DVI-D and HDMI devices (using a suitable adapter cable). There is also a mini DisplayPort format (MiniDP or mDP), developed by Apple and licensed to other vendors.\ntag: C1 L2 TA FIGURE

THUNDERBOLT AND USB-C PORTS AND CONNECTORS\nHistorically, computer video used dedicated cable types such as HDMI or DisplayPort. Modern computer display equipment is quickly adopting the USB-C connector Thunderbolt and USB-interface. USB-C can carry HDMI or DisplayPort signaling (with an adapter cable) but would usually be used with Thunderbolt 3 signaling for video support.  Note: Not all USB-C ports support Thunderbolt 3. Look for the flash icon on the port or confirm using the system documentation.\n\n(https://4sorcero.s3.amazonaws.com/byteback/core_1/fig_core_1_85.png)\nA USB-C connector with Thunderbolt 3 support.

VIDEO ADAPTERS AND CONVERTERS\nMany video cards provide support for older display standards. It might be that the video card itself is quite old but it can be useful for newer video cards to support interfaces that might only be found on older monitors and projectors. If there is no port common to both the computer and the monitor, you may be able to use a converter or adapter cable to connect them.\n\nIt will often be the case where the graphics adapter comes with a physical interface that is not supported by the display device. In this scenario, you can use a converter cable or adapter plug to connect the devices:\n\nDVI TO HDMI\nDVI is not supported on many consumer devices so you may use this type of adapter to connect a laptop to a TV set. There is no signal conversion involved so this can be performed by a passive cable.\n\n(https://4sorcero.s3.amazonaws.com/byteback/core_1/fig_core_1_86a.png)\nHDMI to DVI-I adapter. (Image © 123RF.com.)\n\nDVI OR HDMI TO VGA\nOlder flat panels may only come with VGA ports so this type of converter can be used to connect them up to newer computing devices. Unless going from DVI-I (analog) to VGA, this type of converter requires an active Digital to Analog Converter (DAC) chip. Note that the converter will not be accepted by HDCP-protected content. For instance, a VGA to DVI-I adapter would carry an analog signal only, while an HDMI to VGA converter cable converts between digital and analog inputs or outputs.\n\n(https://4sorcero.s3.amazonaws.com/byteback/core_1/fig_core_1_86b.png)\nVGA to DVI-I adapter.

No signal conversion is involved so only a simple passive cable with appropriate connectors on each end is required.\n\n(https://4sorcero.s3.amazonaws.com/byteback/core_1/fig_core_1_87b.png)\nA Thunderbolt to DVI-I adapter.

VIDEO CARDS\nThe video card (or graphics adapter) generates the signal to send to the monitor or projector. The video card may make use of the system CPU and memory, but most add-in cards are highly sophisticated pieces of equipment, essentially computers in their own right.\n\nNote: Be aware that the terms video, graphics, and display are used interchangeably to refer to these adapters (or cards).\n\nLow-end graphics adapters are likely to be included with the motherboard chipset or as part of the CPU itself. This is also referred to as an onboard adapter. If a computer is to be used for 3D gaming, Computer Aided Design (CAD), or digital artwork, a better quality adapter is required. This can be installed as an add-on card via a PCIe slot. Most graphics adapters are based on chipsets by ATI/AMD (Radeon chipset), NVIDIA (GeForce and nForce chipsets), SiS, VIA, and Intel.

ADAPTER COMPONENTS\n\nThe core of a video adapter is the Graphics Processing Unit (GPU). This is a microprocessor like the CPU, but designed and optimized for processing instructions that render 2D and 3D images on-screen. High-end cards are differentiated based on the following features:\n• Clock speed—as with the CPU, the clock speed is the basic measure of\nperformance, but the internal architecture (pipeline) of the GPU is another important factor.\n• Shader units—support the special effects built into games and other software. These units perform calculations that allow for 3D shading, realistic shadows and lighting, surface textures, translucency, and so on.\n• Frame rate—the basic test for a GPU is the frame rate it can produce for a particular game or application. 25 fps is about the minimum to make a game playable.\n3D cards need a substantial amount of memory for processing and texture effects. A dedicated card may be fitted with up to 12 GB GDDR RAM at the high-end; around 2 GB would be more typical of current mid-range performance cards. The width and speed of the memory bus between the graphics RAM and GPU are also important. Low end cards use shared memory (that is, the adapter uses the system RAM). Some cards may use a mix of dedicated and shared memory.\n\nNote:\nGraphics Double Data Rate (GDDR) memory technology is similar to the DDR modules used for system RAM.\n\nMost modern cards use a PCIe x16 interface. Dual cards, using two (or more) slots, are also available. With NVIDIA cards, this is accomplished using Scalable Link Interface (SLI); AMD/ATI dual cards are branded CrossFire.\ntag: C1 L2 TA

SUPPORT FOR DISPLAY INTERFACES\nModern cards will support at least one digital interface (DVI, HDMI, DisplayPort, or Thunderbolt). Some cards may support other interfaces, such as VGA, but such support for analog display interfaces is increasingly unlikely. Having multiple connectors on the card also allows for the attachment of multiple display devices, even if the connectors are different types.\n\n(https://4sorcero.s3.amazonaws.com/byteback/core_1/fig_core_1_89.png)\nA video/graphics card with DisplayPort, HDMI, and DVI-I ports.

GRAPHICS APIs\nTo work with 3D games and design applications, graphics cards need to be compliant with the specified version of one of the major graphics application programming interfaces (APIs):\n• DirectX —Microsoft's specification. DirectX also specifies sound and multimedia APIs.\n• OpenGL —developed by Silicon Graphics.

CONFIGURATION TOOLS FOR DISPLAY DEVICES\nOnce the adapter card has been installed and the monitor connected via a suitable cable, Windows should detect the devices and make them available for use via Plug and Play.\n\nIf the computer has an onboard adapter, you may need to disable it via the system setup (BIOS) program after installing an add-on card. In some cases though, the utility supplied with the adapter will support selecting the default input and specifying use of a particular adapter for a particular task or process.\n\nBasic display settings, such as the resolution, can be configured via a built-in operating system tool, such as Windows Settings or Windows Control Panel. Alternatively, an adapter card might ship with a dedicated management utility. You would normally access this via an icon in the notification area.\n\n(https://4sorcero.s3.amazonaws.com/byteback/core_1/fig_core_1_90.png)\nIntel utility for configuring graphics properties.\n\nYou may also need to use controls on the monitor itself to adjust the image or select the appropriate input channel. For example, if there is no image on the screen, check that the monitor is set to use the HDMI port that the computer is connected to, rather than an empty DVI port. These On-Screen Display (OSD) menus are operated using buttons on the monitor case. As well as input control, you can usually find settings for brightness, color/contrast, and power saving.\ntag: C1 L2 TA FIGURE

MULTIPLE DISPLAYS\nA computer can be set up to use two (or more) display devices. In terms of hardware, the PC requires a graphics adapter with multiple display ports, multiple graphics adapters, or monitors with input and output DisplayPort or Thunderbolt connectors for daisy-chaining.\n\nNote: The adapter and monitors must support Multi-Stream Transport (MST) to use daisy chaining. To set up the chain, connect the first cable from the graphics adapter port to the "IN" port on the first monitor. Connect a second cable from the "OUT" port on the first monitor to the "IN" port on the second monitor.\n\nDual monitors can be used in one of three modes, configured via Windows display properties:\n• Display the same image on both devices—select the Duplicate these displays option (this mode is useful for delivering presentations)\n\n(https://4sorcero.s3.amazonaws.com/byteback/core_1/fig_core_1_91a.png)\nConfiguring dual monitors in Windows 10 to duplicate the display.

Activity 2-1\nDiscussing Display Device Installation and Configuration\n\nSCENARIO\nAnswer the following questions to check your understanding of the topic.\n\nQuestion 1. Look at the following exhibit.\n\n(https://4sorcero.s3.amazonaws.com/byteback/core_1/fig_core_1_92a.png)\n\nWhat two types of display cabling can be connected to this laptop?\n\nAnswer 1. The image shows a VGA port and an HDMI port (with an RJ-45 network port between them). The USB ports could be used for a portable monitor.\n\nQuestion 2. Which ports are present on the graphics card shown below?\n\n(https://4sorcero.s3.amazonaws.com/byteback/core_1/fig_core_1_92b.png)\n\nAnswer 2. The port on the left is DVI-I and the one on the right is DisplayPort.\n\nQuestion 3.Which interfaces does the adapter cable shown below support?\n\n(https://4sorcero.s3.amazonaws.com/byteback/core_1/fig_core_1_92c.png)\n\nAnswer 3. DVI-I (left) and HDMI (right)\n\nQuestion 4. A customer is shopping for a computer game for her daughter and wants to know if you can explain the reference to "DirectX" on the packaging?\n\nAnswer 4. DirectX is Microsoft's API (Application Programming Interface) for 3D and multimedia applications. Software such as a computer game will specify a minimum DirectX version. The graphics card must support this version to run the game. Vendors often provide support through driver updates, even for older card models.\n\nQuestion 5. You are configuring two monitors in extended desktop mode. What should you configure in the Display dialog box?\n\nAnswer 5. Ensure the layout of the displays in the dialog box matches their physical location.\ntag: C1 L2 TA A2-1


Activity 2-2\nInstalling a Graphics Adapter\n\nBEFORE YOU BEGIN\nWhat you do in this activity will depend on the components available to you. Check with your instructor which of the following steps you should perform. You will perform this activity on your WORKBENCH PC.\n\nSCENARIO\nA common upgrade on machines used for playing games or doing Computer Aided Design or graphics intensive work is to upgrade the graphics adapter. Another upgrade that can be performed is to add a second adapter to the system so that two monitors can be used. This requires that both adapters support dual displays.\n\nQuestion 1. Record information about the graphics adapter make and model currently installed, including the driver version.\na)Start and log on to the PC then press the Windows+X keys and select Device Manager.\nb) In Device Manager, expand the Display adapters node, and record the installed adapter name.\n• Adapter make and model: ____________________________\nIf there are multiple display adapters, record information about all of them.\nc) Right-click the adapter and select Properties. Select the Driver tab, then record the Driver Provider Driver Version\n• Driver provider: ____________________________\n• Driver version: ____________________________\nAgain, if there are multiple display adapters, do this for each of them.\n\nQuestion 2. Access the PC's internal components safely.\na) Shut down the PC and then disconnect the power cable and all peripheral cables.\nTake the usual ESD precautions.\nb) Remove the system case cover.\n\nQuestion 3. Complete this step or one of the next two steps, as suggested by your instructor.\na) If your system has onboard graphics, identify a free expansion slot that will accommodate the type of adapter you are installing.\nb) Remove the blanking plate from the slot.\nc) Insert the card into the slot, checking carefully to make sure that it is properly seated and that any locking catches are in place.\n\nQuestion 4. Complete this step, the previous step, or the next step, as suggested by your instructor.\na) Remove your existing adapter (remember that there may be a plastic clip to release as well as the mounting screw).\nb) Swap adapters with a classmate, and install the new one.\n\nQuestion 5. Complete either this step or one of the previous steps, as suggested by your instructor.\na) Install a second graphics adapter alongside your existing one.\nA second graphics adapter can be installed so that two monitors can be used at the same time. This type of setup is favored by graphics professionals where having lots of screen "real estate" is extremely productive. It can also be used with presenting software.\n\nNote: Another use for twin adapters is for high performance gaming systems where two cards are installed to double performance. Another dual-monitor option is to obtain a "multi-head" card with two or more outputs.\n\nQuestion 6. Verify the installation and configure display settings.\na) Close the system case.\nb) Reconnect the peripheral devices. When connecting the display, make sure you connect the cable to a display port on the new adapter, if you installed a second adapter alongside an integrated one or existing card.\nc) Reconnect the power cable and start the PC.\nd) When the PC reboots, the new adapter should be detected automatically. If it is not, install the driver software that comes with the card.\ne) Right-click the Desktop and select Display settings. Select the Advanced display settings link, and record the following information:\n• Refresh rate: ____________________________\n• Bit depth: ____________________________\nf) Select the Display adapter properties link. Record the following information:\n• Chip type: ____________________________\n• Total Available Graphics Memory: ____________________________\n• Dedicated Video Memory: ____________________________\ng) Select List All Modes to list the combinations of resolution and refresh rate supported by the monitor.\nh) Select Cancel to close each dialog box.\ni) In the Settings app, select the Back button.\nj) Experiment with different text DPI settings by using the Change the size of text list box.\nThese are useful on very high resolution monitors where the on-screen menus can look very small as the default setting (96 dpi).\nk) If you installed a second display adapter, configure the display across the two monitors, experimenting with the options available. When you have finished, set the display back to one monitor. Disconnect the second monitor and connect it back onto the other PC.\n\nQuestion 7. At the end of the activity, if you installed a second adapter, open the computer and remove it then hand it back to your instructor. Revert any other changes as suggested by your instructor.\ntag: C1 L2 TA A2-2

Topic B\nTroubleshoot Display Devices\n\nEXAM OBJECTIVES COVERED\n1001-5.4 Given a scenario, troubleshoot video, projector, and display issues. As well as installing and configuring display devices, you also need to know how to identify and resolve issues related to using them.\ntag: C1 L2 TB

COMMON DISPLAY ISSUES\nCommon display issues include:\n• No image is displayed on the monitor.\n• Image is dim.\n• Image flickers or is distorted.\n• Images have low resolution or color depth.\n• Images and icons are oversized.\n• Incorrect color patterns.\n• Dead pixels.\n• Image is burned into the monitor.\n• Unexpected objects or patterns appear on the monitor.\n• Overheating.\n• Protected content.\ntag: C1 L2 TB

Here are some guidelines to follow to help troubleshoot display devices.\n\nTROUBLESHOOT DISPLAY CONFIGURATION ISSUES\nFollow these guidelines when you are troubleshooting display device configuration issues.\n\nNo image.\n•  If no image is displayed on the monitor, try these actions:\n• Make sure that the monitor is plugged in and turned on. Check that the monitor is not in standby mode (press a key or cycle the power to the monitor to activate it).\n• Check the connection between the video card and monitor. Make sure the cable is connected securely at both ends and is not loose. Make sure that the cable has not become stretched or crimped. If there are dual display ports, check that the cable is connected to the right port.\n• If the monitor supports different display inputs (VGA and HDMI, for instance), check that it is switched to the correct one using the On-Screen Display (OSD) controls.\n• Try the monitor with a different PC and see if it works.\n\nDim image.\n•  If the image is dim, check the brightness and contrast controls to make sure they are not turned all the way down. It is possible that a power saving mode is dimming the display. It is also possible that an adaptive brightness, auto-brightness, or eye-saving feature of the device or operating system has been enabled. These reduce brightness and contrast and can use lower blue light levels. This type of feature might activate automatically at a certain time of day or could use an ambient light sensor to trigger when the room is dark.\n\nImage quality\n•  If there is a problem with image quality, such as a flickering or misshapen image or missing colors, try these actions:\n• Check the video cable and connector. If the connector is not securely inserted at both ends, this could cause flickering. If a pin is bent and not lining up with the video card connector, this can cause a missing color. If the cable is poor quality, higher resolutions may not be supported.\n• If video playback does not work, try lowering or disabling hardware acceleration (using the slider on the Troubleshoot tab). If this solves the problem, check for an updated display driver.\n\n(https://4sorcero.s3.amazonaws.com/byteback/core_1/fig_core_1_97.png)\nConfiguring scaling on a Windows 10 PC. (Screenshot used with permission from Microsoft.)\n\n• Increasing DPI makes text larger at a particular resolution. This is useful for flat panels that support high native resolutions (using a lower interpolated resolution would make the display "fuzzy"). However, this can cause graphics rendering problems with older software. Also, Windows may set a high DPI automatically when using a high resolution display device.\n• If using a CRT monitor, check refresh rate and resolution settings for the video driver. If resolution is too high or refresh rate is too low this can cause the screen to flicker. On a TFT, check that there is no problem with the backlight.\n\n(https://4sorcero.s3.amazonaws.com/byteback/core_1/fig_core_1_98.png)\nThe screen refresh rate setting is located under Advanced Display Properties on the Monitor tab. (Screenshot used with permission from Microsoft.)\n\n• If a CRT image geometry is distorted (a pincushion effect where the edges appear to bulge, for instance), try adjusting the monitor's image control knobs.\n• If a TFT image is distorted, check that the panel has not been bent or physically damaged.\n• If a projector image is distorted, try to ensure the projector lens is lined up with the display screen or whiteboard. The position of the lens within the projector may be adjustable using a knob or dial. If the lens is above or below the screen, there may be a keystone effect where the top of the image is wider or narrower than the bottom. If the projector or lens cannot be repositioned, there may be a keystone correction control, accessed via the OSD menu, that allows you to adjust the digital image to compensate for this.\n\nVGA mode\n•  If there is a problem with low resolution or color depth:\n• Low resolution or color depth (VGA rather than SVGA) can make the image look\nblocky or grainy.\n• If a computer boots in VGA mode without this being specified in the boot\nconfiguration, check the display driver.\n\nNote: Windows 10 does not actually support VGA resolution anymore. The minimum\nresolution is SVGA (800x600).\n\nOversized images and icons.\n•  If images and icons appear oversized:\n• One way for screen objects to look "too large" is to use a low resolution, such as VGA.\n• Another way is to use a high DPI scaling setting, as described previously.\n• You should also check whether a zoom tool is in use. Windows comes with accessibility features to allow the screen to be magnified. A user might unwittingly activate the screen magnifier (especially if it is configured with a hot key activation) and not know how to turn it off.\n\n(https://4sorcero.s3.amazonaws.com/byteback/core_1/fig_core_1_99.png)\nA user may not realize that the Magnifier tool is activated. (Screenshot used with permission from Microsoft.)\n\nColor issues. If there is a problem with color:\n• If a computer is used to produce digital art, it is very important that the display be calibrated to scanning devices and print output. Color calibration (or workflow) refers to a process of adjusting screen and scanner settings so that color input and output are balanced. Color settings should be configured with the assistance of a color profile. You can use the Color Management applet in Control Panel along with test card color patterns and spectrophotometers to define a color profile and verify that the display matches it.\n\n(https://4sorcero.s3.amazonaws.com/byteback/core_1/fig_core_1_100.png)\nDisplay Color Calibration utility in Windows 10. (Screenshot used with permission from Microsoft.)\n\n• You may also come across color glitches, such as purple or green horizontal lines or colors changing unexpectedly. These are usually caused by a faulty or loose connector or cabling that is either faulty or insufficient quality for the current image resolution. Try replacing the cable. If this does not fix the issue, there could be a hardware fault.\n\nNote: On a laptop, one simple test is to check whether the problem manifests on both the built-in display and on an external monitor. If the problem only appears on the external monitor, suspect the cable or connector/port.\ntag: C1 L2 TB FIGURE

TROUBLESHOOT ADAPTER AND MONITOR FAULTS\nMany display problems are caused by errors in configuration, but you must also be alert to the possibility of hardware faults in the graphics adapter or monitor. In addition to the possible effects of a faulty cable or connector, be aware of these issues and possible solutions:\n\nDead pixels. If you have dead pixels:\n• Defects in a flat panel monitor may cause individual pixels to be "stuck" or dead." If a TFT panel has stuck (constantly bright) pixels, and the panel cannot be replaced under warranty, there are software utilities available to cycle the pixel through a series of relatively extreme color states to try to reactivate it.\n\nNote: Many vendors stipulate that they will only replace a screen if the number of manufacturing defects exceeds a stated threshold.\n\n• Fixed pixels can also sometimes be reactivated by gently pressing or tapping the affected area of the screen with a stylus or pencil eraser, though there is the risk of causing further damage or scratching the screen. Dead pixels (solid black) cannot usually be fixed.\n\nBurn-In. if you have burn-in.\n• Burn-in is where a static image is displayed for so long that the monitor's picture elements are damaged and a ghost image is "burned" permanently onto the display. Older monitors were highly prone to burn-in, which is why most operating systems include the option for an automatic screen saver to activate after so many minutes inactivity.\n• Modern flat panel monitors are not so susceptible to burn-in, though it is still worth using a screen saver or power saving mode just in case. Some plasma screens are vulnerable to burn-in and additional care should be taken when using a consumer TV device as display screen.\n\nArtifacts. There are two main sources of unexpected objects or patterns appearing on the screen.\n• If the artifacts are "static" and completely out of context with their surroundings, the likelihood is that the cause is a faulty adapter.\n• Some TFTs can suffer from "image persistence," where the crystals become slightly less responsive because they have been left in the same state for an extended period. The problem can usually be solved by turning off the display for a few hours.\n• In terms of 3D graphics performance and possible motion trails or slowdown (especially with computer games), you need to ensure the card is one that is capable of playing the game and that the latest driver and version of DirectX are installed.\n• If there are still issues with frame rates (the speed at which images are displayed), try disabling video effects or using a lower resolution.\n• Make sure that you are using the correct (and latest) drivers for your video card. The FAQs will list any issues with particular applications that the driver addresses.\n\nUnexpected shutdowns. If you are experiencing unexpected shutdowns:\n• A faulty display adapter or display adapter driver is a common cause of STOP\nerrors, or Blue Screens of Death (BSoD). If the problem occurs only in specific\ncircumstances, the fault could lie in some sort of compatibility between the\ndriver and a particular program (typically a 3D game).\n• If the problem occurs more randomly or at bootup, the issue is more likely to be\na fault in the adapter itself. 3D graphics cards come bundled with high\nperformance GPUs and memory and as such are prone to overheating,\nespecially in laptops. Make sure the system is being adequately cooled as\nprolonged overheating will cause permanent damage to the card.\n\nProtected content. If you encounter an error that indicates unauthorized content\nor an HDCP error:\n• DVI, HDMI, DisplayPort, and Thunderbolt all provide support for the Digital Rights Management (DRM) mechanism High-bandwidth Digital Content Protection (HDCP). HDCP allows a content source (such as a Blu-ray disc) to disable itself if the display adapter and monitor and/or speaker system do not support HDCP and fail to authenticate themselves with the playback source. There have been various iterations of HDCP (at time of writing the current version is 2.2) and backward-compatibility can be problematic as authentication may fail between devices that support different versions of the standard.\ntag: C1 L2 TB

Activity 2-3\nDiscussing Display Device Troubleshooting\n\nSCENARIO\nAnswer the following questions to check your understanding of the topic.\n\nQuestion 1. Imagine that the display you installed is not showing the color blue. Which component(s) would you prioritize for fault-finding?\n\nAnswer 1. The first thing to test is the display cable. If the original cable is properly inserted at the computer and monitor ends, try replacing it with a known good version. If this does not fix the problem, inspect the ports for signs of damage.\n\nQuestion 2. What is the most likely cause of a flickering display?\n\nAnswer 2. On a CRT, flickering can occur if the refresh rate is set too low. On a TFT it could indicate a problem with the backlight. You should also verify that the connectors are secure and rule out other potential cabling problems.\n\nQuestion 3. What would you do if the image from a projector appeared narrower at the top than at the bottom?\n\nAnswer 3. Ensure the projector lens is lined up with the whiteboard. You might be able to adjust the lens position using a knob or have to move the projector. If the projector or lens cannot be repositioned, there may be a digital keystone correction control.\n\nQuestion 4. You need to set up a system to show content-protected video. Which display connector types would be suitable?\n\nAnswer 4. DVI, HDMI, DisplayPort, and Thunderbolt.\ntag: C1 L2 TB A2-3

Activity 2-4\nTroubleshooting Monitor Issues\n\n\nBEFORE YOU BEGIN\nYour instructor has altered the display settings for your monitor. The computer is running and the lock screen is displayed. This activity will be performed on your WORKBENCH PC.\n\nSCENARIO\nAn employee recently had to move the location of his workstation. The employee reports that, since the move, the display does not appear in the center of the monitor. The images are too dark, making them difficult to see, and he cannot see as much on the screen as he would like. The employee needs you to resolve these issues so that he can get back to work.\n\n1. Log on to Windows, and examine the video output.\n\n2. Adjust the monitor display.\na) Referring to the monitor's documentation as necessary, locate the physical controls or On Screen Display (OSD) menu to adjust the brightness of the display image.\nb) Adjust the brightness so that the monitor is comfortable to view.\nc) Adjust the contrast so that you can view all the screen elements easily.\n\n3. Change the resolution.\na) To open the Screen Resolution window, if you are using a Windows 7 computer, right-click the desktop and select Display settings. If you are using a Windows 10 computer, right-click the desktop and select  .\nb) In the Resolution section, select the current resolution to display the drop-down list.\nc) In the Screen Resolution window, select the appropriate resolution\nd) If you are using Windows 7, select OK.\ne) In the Display Settings message box, select Keep changes to set the new resolution.\n\n4. Adjust the horizontal and vertical positions of the image.\na) Referring to the documentation as necessary, locate the controls to adjust the size and centering of the display image.\nb) Adjust the vertical display position so that the display is centered top-to-bottom on the screen.\nc) Adjust the horizontal display position so that the display is centered side-to-side on the screen.\nd) Adjust the height and width of the image so that there is either no border or the smallest border allowed.\ntag: C1 L2 TB A2-4

Topic C\nInstall and Configure Multimedia Devices\n\nEXAM OBJECTIVES COVERED\n1001-3.6 Explain the purposes and uses of various peripheral types.\n\nMultimedia refers to devices used to play and record audio and video from different inputs and outputs. You will need to be able to support a wide range of multimedia devices, including speakers, microphones, headsets, and cameras.\ntag: C1 L2 TC

AUDIO SUBSYSTEMS\nA computer's audio subsystem is made up of a sound card (to process audio signals and provide interfaces for connecting equipment) and one or more input (microphone) and output (speaker) devices.\ntag: C1 L2 TC

SOUND CARDS\nThe basis of a sound (or audio) card is the Digital Signal Processor (DSP) chip, which Digital-to-Analog Converters (DACs) contains one or more. DACs convert the digital signals generated by the CPU to an analog electrical signal that can drive the speakers. The DSP also provides functions for playing digital sound (synthesis) and driving MIDI compatible devices. The quality of audio playback is determined by the card's frequency response, which is the volume that can be produced at different frequencies.\n\nA basic sound chip may be provided as part of the motherboard chipset, but better quality audio functions can be provided as a PCI or PCIe expansion card, or as an external adapter connected by USB. Pro-level cards may also feature onboard memory, flash memory storing sound samples (wavetables), and multiple jacks for different input sources.\n\nNote: Locating recording functions within the computer case creates lots of problems with noise. Consequently, most audio interfaces designed for professional use are now external units connected via USB or Thunderbolt.\n\nAs with graphics cards, sound cards are designed to support sound APIs. Cards designed for use with Windows should support Microsoft's DirectSound3D (part of DirectX). Cards designed for use with games should also support Open AL and EAX, which provide extensions to DS3D for special sound effects.\n\nCreative, Terratec, RealTek, and Turtle Beach are the most notable vendors of consumer sound cards, while M-Audio, RME, and Apogee are noted for their professional-level cards.\ntag: C1 L2 TC

AUDIO CONNECTORS\nMost audio connectors are 3.5 mm (⅛ inch) mono or stereo jacks (also referred to as phone plugs or mini TRS [Tip, Ring, Sleeve] connectors). A standard sound card will have several of these for different equipment.\n\n(https://4sorcero.s3.amazonaws.com/byteback/core_1/fig_core_1_105a.png)\nAudio jacks on a sound card. (Image © 123RF.com.)\n\n(https://4sorcero.s3.amazonaws.com/byteback/core_1/table_core_1_105.png)\n\nJack | Description\nAudio in (light blue): Audio in (or line in) is a low-level (1V) stereo signal as supplied by most tape decks, video players, tuners, CD players, and so on.\nMicrophone input (pink): This is generally a mono-only analog input.\nAudio out (lime): Audio out (or line out) is a low-level (1V) analog stereo signal suitable for feeding into amplified speakers or headphones.\nAudio out (black): Carries the signal for rear speakers in a surround sound system.\nAudio out (orange): Carries the signal for the subwoofer in a surround sound system.\n\nHigher end sound cards will include an Sony/Phillips Digital Interface (S/PDIF) jack. S/PDIF can either use coax cabling with RCA (or phono) connectors or fiber optic cabling and connectors, which can either be in a square form factor (TOSLINK) or use 3.5mm jacks. S/PDIF is most often used to carry digital data for surround-sound speaker systems.\n\n(https://4sorcero.s3.amazonaws.com/byteback/core_1/fig_core_1_105b.png)\nA TOSLINK connector and port. (Image © 123RF.com.)\n\nNote: RCA connectors are distinguished by a collar surrounding the connector, which makes the fit between plug and socket more secure.\ntag: C1 L2 TC FIGURE TABLE

AUDIO OUTPUT DEVICES\nAudio playback is achieved via speakers or headphones, which are connected to the sound card via an analog or digital audio jack. Both analog and digital speakers are available (or speakers may support both analog and digital inputs).\nSound cards supporting multiple output channels with an appropriate speaker system can provide various levels of playback, from mono (on legacy systems) or stereo to some type of surround sound. Surround sound uses multiple speakers positioned around the listener to provide a "cinematic" audio experience.\n• A 5.1 digital system (Dolby Digital or Digital Theater System [DTS]) has three front center, left, and right speakers, two left and right rear speakers, and a subwoofer for bass sounds.\n• A 7.1 system (Dolby Digital Plus or DTS-HD) has two extra side speakers. A speaker system will usually have controls for adjusting volume, bass, and treble plus optionally EQ or preset sound effects.\n\nNote: A sound card will also feature internal channels (or voices). These represent the number of sounds that the card can play and mix at once (polyphony). This is important for music recording and working with sound effects used by some games.\n\nNote: Most graphics adapters support audio over HDMI (or Thunderbolt), allowing surround sound output without a separate connection to a sound card. An HDMI cable would be connected from the graphics adapter port to the TV and then the TV would be connected to the surround sound speaker system.\n\n(https://4sorcero.s3.amazonaws.com/byteback/core_1/fig_core_1_106.png)\nSurround sound configuration for a home theater. (Image © 123RF.com.)\ntag: C1 L2 TC FIGURE

MIDI EQUIPMENT\nAs well as playing sound via speakers, a card supporting Musical Instrument Digital Interface (MIDI) functions can be used to control MIDI equipment (such as a synthesizer or drum machine).\n\nInstead of exchanging the sound wave, the devices exchange information about how to play a sound, in terms of sample (a sound pattern stored in a wavetable), volume, pitch, tempo, and so on. For example, you could use a keyboard to play with samples stored on the PC or use sequencing software to program a drum machine. MIDI devices use 5-pin DIN connectors or USB connectors.\ntag: C1 L2 TC

SOUND RECORDING EQUIPMENT\nTo record an analog sound wave, the sound card must sample the wave. The sampler divides the wave up into a number of slices per second (sampling rate) and records information about each slice (resolution). The higher the sampling rate (measured in Kilohertz [KHz]) and resolution (measured in bits), the better the representation of the source is. CD-quality audio is sampled at 16-bit/44.1 KHz, but professional cards may sample at 24-bit/192 KHz or better.\n\nThe card's circuitry and cabling introduce some degree of noise or distortion into the sampled audio. Noise levels are measured using Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) and Total Harmonic Distortion (THD). THD is measured as a percentage and SNR in decibels (dB). For both, smaller values represent better performance.\n\nNote: When using a PC to record music, the acoustic performance of components such as the hard drive and fans is very important, so as not to cause interference with analog inputs. Locate an internal sound card in the slot farthest from any other components.\n\nA sound card can be fitted with several ports to connect different types of recording equipment.\ntag: C1 L2 TC

HEADSETS\nA headset combines headphones and a microphone in a single device. They are mostly used with Voice over IP (VoIP) calling, meeting, and conferencing applications. Most headsets are connected to the computer via a USB port or via a wireless interface, such as Bluetooth.\ntag: C1 L2 TC

AUDIO SETTINGS\nTo set up the audio subsystem, connect the microphone, headset, or speakers to the appropriate ports on the card or motherboard. Use the Sound applet in Control Panel or Windows Settings to test the hardware and configure settings.\n\n(https://4sorcero.s3.amazonaws.com/byteback/core_1/fig_core_1_108a.png)\nUsing Sound settings in Windows 10 to configure the audio output and input devices. (Screenshot used with permission from Microsoft.)\n\nIf you have multiple devices connected at the same time, you can choose the defaults here and test levels for audio input and output.\n\nIf you have a multimedia keyboard, there are usually keys on that for adjusting the volume. Also, laptops have push-buttons and special function (Fn) keys to adjust the volume.\n\nIn Windows, use the Speakers icon in the Notification Area to control the volume and switch between playback devices.\n\n(https://4sorcero.s3.amazonaws.com/byteback/core_1/fig_core_1_108b.png)\nWindows volume control.

WEBCAMS\nWebcams record video images using a CMOS or CCD sensor and usually feature a microphone to record audio. Most webcams now support HD recording but may come with quite low quality lenses and records at up to about 30 frames per second (fps). Higher quality devices for professional recording and 4K resolution are available. Webcams are used for online video conferencing, as feeds for websites, and as surveillance devices.\n\n(https://4sorcero.s3.amazonaws.com/byteback/core_1/fig_core_1_109.png)\nBuilt-in and USB-attached webcam options. (Image © 123RF.com.)\n\nWebcams can be built into a laptop computer chassis or connected as a peripheral\ndevice via an external USB port. Some webcams may come with Wi-Fi networking\nfunctionality.\n\nNote: With webcams—and especially built-in webcams—it is important to enforce app permissions to prevent privacy abuses. While an application such as a browser might need to use the webcam for video conferencing from a particular service provider, that does not mean that other websites should be able to activate the camera.\ntag: C1 L2 TC FIGURE

DIGITAL CAMERAS\nDigital cameras are primarily still cameras, though many can record HD video too. They record an image using a light-sensitive CCD or CMOS array and store it on digital media (a flash memory card). Properties of 35 mm film, such as ISO sensitivity, can be set through software. Digital compact cameras dispense with traditional viewfinders and allow the user to compose each shot using a preview image on an LCD display screen. In other respects, digital cameras have the same features and functions as film cameras.\n\n(https://4sorcero.s3.amazonaws.com/byteback/core_1/fig_core_1_110.png)\nFrom left to right: A compact action camera, a DSLR digital camera. (Image © 123RF.com.)\n\nThe digicam market is divided into consumer models (replicating the features of compact 35 mm film cameras), professional Digital Single Lens Reflex (DSLR) models (preserving the traditional viewfinder method of picture composition and supporting replaceable lenses and manual adjustments), and prosumer models (ranging from high end compacts to entry-level DSLRs). Additionally, smartphones and tablets now come with a camera function.\n\nNote: There are also mirrorless cameras, which support interchangeable lenses but do not use an optical viewfinder.\n\nApart from its lens, shutter speed, and feature set, the basic quality measurement of a digital camera is its resolution, expressed in megapixels (MP). The following table lists the best output that can be expected from images of a particular resolution.\n\n(https://4sorcero.s3.amazonaws.com/byteback/core_1/table_core_1_110.png)\n\nResolution | Uses\nLess than 1 MP: On-screen viewing only.\n1 to 2 MP: On-screen viewing and small prints (up to about 7 inches).\n3 MP: Larger prints (up to about 12 inches, or letter sized).\n4 to 8 MP: and higher Poster prints (30 inches and larger).\n\nNote: In point of fact, image resolution is now less important than the physical size of the sensor. Compact digicams support high resolution but have tiny sensors, while DSLRs have high resolution and larger sensors (the best quality have a "full frame" sensor; the same size as a frame of 35 mm film).\n\nAnother important factor is the type of memory card used by the camera. Cameras can only use one type of card. Most cameras convert images to compressed (JPEG) file format to save space. JPEG is a lossy compression algorithm, meaning that even at the highest quality setting, some image information is discarded. Professional and prosumer models can typically record uncompressed (RAW) data, but this requires about 2-3 times as much space per picture.\n\nPicture files can be transferred to a PC using the removable memory card or the camera can be connected directly using USB or (on some models) over Wi-Fi wireless networking. Many printers also support memory card slots or connectivity for direct printing from a camera without requiring a PC.\ntag: C1 L2 TC FIGURE TABLE

Activity 2-5\nDiscussing Multimedia Device Installation and Configuration\n\nSCENARIO\nAnswer the following questions to check your understanding of the topic.\n\nQuestion 1. What size and color connector would you look for to plug a basic microphone into a PC?\n\nAnswer 1. 3.5mm jack, which is often color coded pink.\n\nQuestion 2. You have installed a new sound card in a computer designed for home entertainment. What type of connector would you use to connect a digital surround sound speaker system to the new card?\n\nAnswer 2. S/PDIF—optical or coax. Coax for audio uses RCA connectors. An optical S/PDIF connector is also sometimes referred to as TOSLINK. Note that a lot of home entertainment setups might just output audio over HDMI with the signal from the graphics adapter.\n\nQuestion 3. What type of speaker unit is the ".1" in a 5.1 or 7.1 surround sound system and where do you suggest this speaker be placed?\n\nAnswer 3. Subwoofer for bass (low frequency) response. Start with placing it in the front of the room, but consider trying other locations to see where you get the best base response for the space in which the surround sound system is set up.\n\nQuestion 4. What type of interface would allow a software program running on the PC to operate a synthesizer connected as a peripheral device?\n\nAnswer 4. MIDI (Musical Instrument Digital Interface).\n\nQuestion 5. What sampling rate from a sound card would you require if you want to be able to record CD-quality sound?\n\nAnswer 5. 16-bit @ 44.1 KHz.\ntag: C1 L2 TC A2-5
